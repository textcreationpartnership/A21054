            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>To this purpoſe makes that prayer of the church for the king. Pſal. 20. 1. <hi>The Name of the God of Jacob defend thee,</hi> or <hi>ſet thee on an high place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man that in a caſe of feare and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will wiſely provide for his ſafety, muſt doe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Hee muſt make choyce and pitch upon a place, or perſon in whom,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:233:20"/> and which there is ſuch a ſufficiency that ſafety and ſecurity may bee had. As in time of warre, when a man is in feare or danger of an enemy he will not truſt to his houſe, but he makes choyce of a fort, of a caſtle, of a tower. And not of any tower, or caſtle neither, not of a weake tower, of an unfurniſhed tower, but of a <hi>ſtrong Tower,</hi> ſtrongly built, ſtrongly mand, well munitioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hee muſt betake himſelfe, and that with ſpeed alſo to that place, or perſon. He muſt not onely goe, but hee muſt <hi>Runne,</hi> betake himſelfe with ſpeed. Both thoſe things muſt be done in a wiſe proviſion for ſafety. For if a man doe Runne to a Tower, yet if that bee a weake and an inſufficient tower, without men and munition, and a Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſhaken Tower: or if a man doe make choyce of a Tower a ſtrong ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tower, yet if in his danger he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not himſelfe to that Tower, but he ſit ſtill: or if he ſit not ſtill, yet hee but onely goe, and walke on eaſily towards it, hee may well bee met withall and a danger may arreſt him, ſurprize him, and cut him off before he get the Tower
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:233:21"/> over his head. But the man that will be ſafe, as he muſt chooſe a ſtrong Tower, ſo hee muſt goe to, nay <hi>Runne</hi> into that <hi>Tower. Running</hi> will not ſecure a man unleſſe the Tower be <hi>ſtrong.</hi> The <hi>ſtrong Tower</hi> will not ſecure a man unleſſe hee <hi>Runne.</hi> There muſt bee <hi>ſtrength</hi> in the Tower, and <hi>ſpeed</hi> in the pace. A <hi>weake</hi> Tower, or a <hi>ſlow</hi> pace, either of them layes a man open to the danger. But when the <hi>Tower</hi> is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and a man <hi>Runnes,</hi> then is a man in <hi>ſafety.</hi> Now thus it is in Running to God in a caſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is the ſureſt project for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. for</p>

And puts the queſtion what a man ſhould doe for his ſafety at that time, <hi>who can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his indignation, and who can abide in the fierceneſſe of his Anger?</hi> What ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:233:21"/> a man doe, what courſe ſhall he take for his ſafety, when his fury is powred out like fire, and the rockes are throwne downe? The anſwer to that queſtion is laid downe, verſ. 7. <hi>The Lord is Good, A ſtrong Hold in the day of trouble.</hi> The time it may be might bee ſuch a time as <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13. <hi>It is an evill time,</hi> The dayes it may be might be ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>The dayes are evill.</hi> I but ſaies the Prophet, <hi>The Lord is Good.</hi> The dangers many, and exceeding Great, I but <hi>the Lord is a ſtrong hold in the day of Trouble.</hi> Excellent is that, Pſal. 46. 1. <hi>God is our Refuge, and our ſtrength, a very preſent helpe in Trouble.</hi> If a perſon had ſlaine a man at unawarres hee was to flee unto one of the cities of Refuge, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 6. why God would have three of thoſe cities in three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts of the Land, <hi>Leaſt the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of bloud purſue the ſlayer whileſt his heart is hot, and overtake him becauſe the way is long, and ſlay him.</hi> Therefore would God have them in divers places, becauſe a man ſlaying another at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares might bee neere to one of thoſe cities, and ſo prevent danger by getting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:233:22"/> into one of them for ſanctuary. Now if once a man were within the walls, or gates of one of thoſe cities of Refuge, then hee was ſafe. Let the Avenger of bloud follow as hard as he would, and let his <hi>heart bee as hot</hi> as it would, yet if once within the city of Refuge, the man was ſafe. When the Avenger of bloud purſued hotly, a man was in <hi>preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> but if he got but the city of Refuge over his head, though the Avenger pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued at his very heeles, yet the city of Refuge was a <hi>very preſent helpe,</hi> in that time of danger. So ſaith the Pſalme, <hi>God is our Refuge,</hi> our city of Refuge. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe troubles and dangers ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a man as cloſe at the heeles as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of bloud did the man ſlayer, it may bee in ſuch a caſe of danger, there was no poſſibility of eſcape, yes that there were, <hi>God is our Refuge, and our ſtrength, a very preſent helpe in trouble,</hi> let dangers be as preſent as may be, yet hee is a <hi>very preſent helpe.</hi> There is an All-ſufficiency in God both for defence and offence. There is no danger ſo great or preſent, from which his power is not able to reſcue. No power ſo great, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:233:22"/> he is not able to cruſh, and breake.</p>
                  <p>The ſafety of a ſtrong Tower ſtands in two things. 1. That it is for <hi>Defence,</hi> ſo as to keepe an enemy off, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a man within it from the danger of enemies without. 2. That it is for <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> ſo as to hurt, and ſpoyle an enemy without. A Tower not onely guards, and keepes a man ſafe, but it hath ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ammunition, with which it keepes off, and beats off, and beates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way enemies. A <hi>weake</hi> perſon from a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Tower may doe a great deale of miſchiefe to a ſtrong enemy. <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> and a ſorry woman were an unequall match, what was a weake woman to him? And yet a <hi>weake woman</hi> having the advantage of a <hi>ſtrong Tower,</hi> proved too good for him, for <hi>a woman from the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſts a piece of a milſtone upon abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecks head, and brake his ſkul.</hi> Iudg. 9, 53. Now ſuch a <hi>ſtrong Tower</hi> is the Lord. He hath All-ſufficiency of ſtrength to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, free and protect from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whatſoever, and hee hath All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Power to beate, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſpoyle all ſuch adverſaries as ſhal aſſault any within this Tower. Hee is a

The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Tyrus</hi> gloried much in the ſtrength of her towers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 11. <hi>The Gamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dims were in thy towers, they hanged their ſhields upon thy walles, round about.</hi> They had towers, and thoſe towers were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:233:27"/> mand, and furniſhed with ſtout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>Gammadims. Gammadims in their Towers.</hi> But though they had ſuch To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and <hi>Gammadims in their Towers,</hi> yet becauſe they had not God in their towers, becauſe God was not their ſtrong tower, therefore their ſtrong To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and their <hi>Gammadims</hi> could not keepe out <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but he came and brake down her towers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He ſhall ſet engines of war againſt thy walls, and with his axes ſhall hee breake downe thy Towers.</hi> It was a great deale of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that <hi>Niniveh</hi> put in her ſtrong holds. <hi>Nahum</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Fortifie thy ſtrong holds, goe into clay, and tread the mortar:</hi> The Prophet derides all their care, and coſt in their fortifications. It is a bitter ſarcaſme by which he flouts the vanitie of all the courſes they ſhould ſeeke to ſecure themſelves from the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> They had not made God their Tower, nor had not runne into that Tower, and therefore ſee what all their towers, and forts would come to. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>All thy ſtrong holds ſhallbe like figtrees with the firſt ripe figs, If they be ſhaken, they ſhall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</hi> Ripe figs they drop
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:233:28"/> downe with the leaſt concuſſion, with the leaſt jog of the figtree, and fall into the mouth of the eater. Juſt ſo eaſily ſhould their forts, and holds yeeld to the Chaldeans that longed to be eating, and devouring them. When God is not mens ſtrong hold, <hi>he ſhakes kingdomes,</hi> as a man would ſhake a fig tree, and hee gives a <hi>commandement to deſtroy ſtrong holds,</hi> or the ſtrengths of a citty. Iſay 23. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a great deale of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is put in ſtout men, in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly horſes. When God is not ſought unto, and he not truſted in as a man of war to fight our battels, ſo many men but ſo many women. <hi>Nah.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Behold thy people in the midſt of thee are women,</hi> no more heart, no more courage in them then in women. And what ſafety in an Army of women? Pſal. 20. 7. <hi>Some truſt in charets, and ſome in horſes.</hi> But <hi>an horſe is a vaine thing for ſafety.</hi> Pſal. 33. 17. <hi>The horſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is prepared againſt the day of battell.</hi> Pro. 21. 31. <hi>But ſafety is of the Lord.</hi> The ſafety is not from the horſe, for the <hi>horſe is fleſh, and not ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 31. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a great deale of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:233:28"/> that men put in their wealth and riches, Pro. 18. 11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong city, and as an high wall in his conceit.</hi> Come what can or will come, thinkes many a rich man, he hath mony and wealth, and <hi>mony anſwers all things.</hi> Hee conceives himſelfe as ſafe in the middeſt of his wealth, as if hee had a Tower as high as Heaven, as if incloſed within walles like Ierichoes, as <hi>high as heaven.</hi> He is immured within his ſilver walles, and fortified within his golden towers, and hee thinkes himſelfe paſt the reach of all dangers: but if a man have not made God his Tower, and be not gotten within that tower, thoſe gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſilver towers will afford a man no ſafety at all. <hi>Riches availe not in the day of wrath,</hi> Pro. 11. 4. It is true indeed, that at ſome times, and in ſome caſes, <hi>The ranſome of a mans life are his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> Proverbs 13. 8. And in ſome caſes <hi>mony is a defence, or a ſhadow,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 12. But when Gods wrath breakes out in ſore judgements, then mony in another ſenſe is but <hi>a ſhadow.</hi> It is poore ſafety that it will yeeld in ſuch a time, Zeph. 1. 18. <hi>Neither their ſilver, nor their gold, ſhall</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:233:29"/> 
                     <hi>be able to deliver them in the day of the Lords wrath.</hi> Nay, it is that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times expoſes a man to the more danger, as many a mans finger is the ſooner cut off for his gold ring, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mans throat the ſooner cut for his wealth. It is a certaine thing, that in the <hi>Pariſian</hi> maſſacre, many that were Papiſts, were murthered, as well as <note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is a great deale of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that men put in getting honours,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:233:29"/> preferments, and high places; but the ſafetie is not anſwerable to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Some ſet <hi>their neſts on high, Hab.</hi> 2. 9. and that upon this ground, <hi>That they may be delivered from the power of evill.</hi> But a <hi>neſt on high</hi> will not deliver from evil. Some birds build their <hi>neſts</hi> on high: but yet if the trees cannot bee climbd; they may be cut down. That ſame tree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12. which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in his dreame, the <hi>height therof was great, the tree grew, and was ſtrong, and the height reached unto heaven, and the Fowles of the heaven dwelt in the boughes thereof, they made their neſts in the boughes of that high tree,</hi> &amp; ſo made their neſts on high. But yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. ſee what the watchman ſayd, <hi>Hew down the tree, and cut downe his branches:</hi> &amp; where were thoſe <hi>neſts</hi> then? Then thoſe neſts on high, were laid low enough. What ſafetie in a neſt on high, when the tree is hewed downe!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it is a great confidence that men put in their outward priviledges, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, Ier.</hi> 7. 4. that was the buckler the Iewes held out to fence off all blowes, as if the Temple had been a ſtrong Tower
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:233:30"/> to have ſaved them from all dangers, as if the Temple walles had been Canon-proofe: and yet the Lord there tells them, that the Temple ſhould be ſo far from freeing them from wrath, that wrath ſhold fall upon the temple it ſelf They conceived not a litle ſafetie in the altar. They thought <hi>Ariel</hi> the Lion of God, the braſen Altar of ſacrifice to be a braſen wall about them. But <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 1. 2. <hi>Woe unto Ariel,</hi> that is, to the Altar, and to the Temple: <hi>Ariel</hi> ſhall bee ſo farre from ſaving you from diſtreſſe, that <hi>Ariel it ſelfe ſhall bee diſtreſſed. Ioab</hi> fled to the Altar in his feare and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and tooke ſanctuary there, and yet his doome was, <hi>Fall upon him there.</hi> The Prophet bids them, not <hi>truſt in lying words, Ier.</hi> 7. To truſt in priviledges, and to place ſecuritie in them againſt Gods Anger is to truſt in a lye. And of truſting in outward priviledges, it may be ſaid as <hi>Mic.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The houſes</hi> of <hi>Achzib</hi> ſhall be <hi>Achzab,</hi> that is, a lye to the Kings of Iſrael. Thus there is a vanitie in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes, and confidences, beſides this, and all the Towers beſides this, to which men betake themſelves, are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:233:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> but paper Towers, paper Caſtles, and ſuch as will prove but towers of <hi>Babel,</hi> towers of confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the betaking of our ſelves to the ſtrong tower of Gods Name; is that which puts ſtrength unto all meanes we uſe, and courſes wee take, and makes them ſucceſſefull: This Tower ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens all other towers: this makes them to bee ſtrong towers: this makes them that they wil beare a brunt, and a ſhock, this makes ſtrong holds hold out. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was faine often to betake himſelfe to holds and forts for his ſafety, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 4. and 23. And <hi>David</hi> aboad in the wilderneſſe in <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> verſe 29. And <hi>David</hi> went up from thence, and <hi>dwelt in ſtrong holds at En-Gedi.</hi> And wee ſee that <hi>Saul</hi> could not get him, hee was ſafe in his holds, and fortreſſes. And how ſo? becauſe as <hi>David</hi> dwelt in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke himſelfe to thoſe holds, ſo hee made God his hold, and the <hi>houſe of his fortreſſes.</hi> Pſalme 31. 3. <hi>David</hi> tooke forts and holds for his ſafety, but yet he made God his tower, &amp; ſtrength, and not his holds, and ſo his ſafety was from God, and not from his holds.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:233:31"/> 1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 23. 14. <hi>and David abode in ſtrong holds &amp; Saul ſought him every day, but God delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not into his hands.</hi> The text ſayes not, but his holds kept him out of <hi>Sauls</hi> hands, but <hi>God kept him</hi> out of <hi>Sauls</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. So that <hi>David</hi> making God his hold, hee was the ſtrength of his hold. See how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>Thou art mine hold, and mine high Tower,</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>En-Gedi</hi> is my ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hold, or the wildernes of <hi>Ziph</hi> is my ſtrong hold, but <hi>Thou art mine hold.</hi> And this was it that made the wildernes of <hi>Ziph,</hi> and the holds of <hi>En-Gedi</hi> ſuch ſtrong holds, becauſe he had made God his hold, and his ſtrong tower. The cave in which <hi>David</hi> was hid, and into which <hi>Saul</hi> came, was a Cave in the wilderneſſe of <hi>En-Gedi,</hi> &amp; in that cave he found ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and ſhelter from <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; yet ſee how he ſpeaks, Pſal. 57. 1. <hi>My ſoule truſts in thee, yea in the ſhadow of thy wings will I make my refuge &amp;c.</hi> wee ſee by the title of the pſalm, upon what occaſion it was made, <hi>when he fled from Saul in the cave,</hi> &amp; he ſaies not, I truſt in my Cave, in the ſhadow of the cave, wil I make my refuge, but my <hi>ſoul truſts in thee, In the ſhadow of thy wings wil I make my refuge,</hi> he made God his cave &amp; his hiding place, &amp; therupon his cave
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:233:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> became a ſhadow, and a ſhelter to him.</p>
                  <p>It is lawfull for us, and it is that wee ought to doe, to uſe all good meanes for our ſafety in caſes of danger, but yet the firſt thing to bee done, is to make God our ſtrong Tower, and this is it which will make them meanes of ſafety, mark that place, 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. 7. <hi>let us build theſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and make about them walls, and towers, gates, &amp; bars.</hi> Firſt they made God their Tower, as appeares in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>becauſe we have ſought the Lord our God,</hi> and in the words before verſe. 4. He commanded Iudah to <hi>ſeeke the Lord God of their fathers,</hi> and when they had made God their tower, and wall of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then they ſaid, <hi>let us build and make Towers.</hi> And when they took this courſe, then they went to work to the purpoſe. <hi>So they built &amp; proſpered,</hi> ſaies the end of the verſ. This is the way to make all our counſels, projects, &amp; courſes for ſafety, to proſper, &amp; do wel. <hi>So they built &amp; proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi> that is, when they had ſought God, &amp; had made him their ſtrong tower firſt. Firſt make God our tower, &amp; then build and proſper, then project, and proſper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider what a miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:233:32"/> confuſion, and diſtraction of ſpirit, it will bee in a time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bee <hi>fort-leſſe,</hi> and <hi>Tower-leſſe.</hi> Looke in what a caſe the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were. Ioſh. 2. 10. 11. <hi>For wee have heard how the Lord dryed up the waters of the red ſea for you, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And as ſoone as wee heard thoſe things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remaine any more courage in any man becauſe of you.</hi> Looke in what a caſe the Iewes were, Iſa. 7. 2. <hi>And it was told the houſe of David ſaying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim: and his heart was moved, and the heart of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the trees of the wood are moved with the winde.</hi> How ſad is that paſſage. Ier. 30. 5. 6. 7. <hi>Wee have heard a voyce of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, of feare, and not of peace, aske now and ſee whether a man doth travell with childe? wherfore doe I ſee every man with his hands on his loynes as a woman with childe, and all faces turned into paleneſſe? Alas, for that day is great, &amp;c.</hi> This is the miſerable, and diſconſolate condition of many men in the times of their trouble. Now what ayles them, what brings them into ſuch diſtreſſes of ſpirit. Poore men, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:233:32"/> are <hi>Towerleſſe,</hi> they have no tower to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to; they are not runne into this Tower of Gods Name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their feares doe racke and torture them, doe even mad them, and make them out of their wits. What are they better, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 21, 22. <hi>They are hard beſtead, &amp; fret themſelves, and curſe their King, and their God, they looke upward, and they looke downward;</hi> and which way ſoever they looke, they behold <hi>trouble and darkneſſe.</hi> It would make a man pitty <hi>Moab,</hi> to ſee him toyled and turmoyled with his own diſtractions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>Hee ſhall</hi> in his feares and perplexities of ſpirit, try all concluſions for his ſafetie. <hi>He ſhall goe to his high place and pray there, and ſhall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelfe,</hi> with trying what may bee done there, and ſhall goe from thence with his heart as full of feares as before. His feares ſhall gaſter him as much as before he went to his high place.

And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:233:33"/> when he hath tryed his ſanctuarie, how cheeres hee then? Alas, ſtill in as bad a caſe as before, <hi>but hee ſhall not prevaile,</hi> neither his high place, nor his ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor all his prayers, nor devotions, can give his heart any eaſe of his feares. So unconceiveably miſerable is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of thoſe mens ſpirits in time of trouble, that are not gotten into this Tower. Their feares and terrours racke and rend their hearts in pieces, like ſo many wilde horſes. And who then would bee towerleſſe in a time of trouble? Who would bee to ſeeke of a Tower then?

                  <p>But now let a man be gotten into this Tower, and with what ſerenitie, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, quiet of ſpirit, ſhall a man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe his ſoule in patience? He may even laugh at ſword, famine, peſtilence, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calamitie. It is an incredible thing to worldly men, that a godly man in ſuch times ſhould have his heart without feare, without diſtracting, aſtoniſhing, ſtounding feare.

But as very a riddle as they judge it, yet it is a ſure truth: and this is the reaſon, and the ground of it; becauſe they are not found towerleſſe, and fortleſſe in a day of evill, they are gotten within the gates and walles of a ſtrong Tower, and this puts their hearts into ſo ſweet and compoſed a frame. See <hi>Pſalme</hi> 46. 1, 2, 3. <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent helpe in trouble: Therefore will not we feare, though the earth bee moved, and though the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines be carried into the midſt of the ſea; Though the waters thereof roare, and bee troubled, though the mountaines ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> To ſee the earth removed, to ſee mountaines car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the midſt of the ſea, to heare the waters rore &amp; be troubled, to ſee the mountaines ſhake, theſe are dreadfull things to ſee and heare, things able to move, melt, and ſhake the heart of the ſtouteſt man that lives, with feare, and yet ſayes the <hi>Pſalme, We will not feare.</hi>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:233:34"/>
                  <p> Now whence came this ſtrength, and incredible preſence of ſpirit?

                     <p>Firſt the knowledge of him in all his glorious attributes of his wiſdome, power, mercy, providence. Wee muſt know him to bee a God ſo wiſe as can Infatuate all the crafty counſels, and policies of enemies, to bee a God of ſuch power that hee is able to deliver, and defend all that doe betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him for ſuccour, To bee a God tender-hearted, merciful, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to his people in their diſtreſſes, To bee a provident God that hath the ordering and governing of all events, and occurrences here below. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there muſt bee the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>A man that will Runne to a Tower for ſafety, he muſt</p>
                     <p>Firſt, know that there is ſuch a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Though there bee a Tower, yet if a man know not of it, or know not the way to it, hee will never Runne to it,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:233:35"/> for who will Runne hee knowes not whether.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hee muſt know that it is ſuch a Tower as it is, of ſufficient ſtrength for ſafety and defence, for if hee know that there is a Tower, and doe know the way to that Tower, yet if hee doe not know it to bee a Tower of ſtrength, a Tower of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that is able to hold out an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hee will have no heart to Runne unto it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He muſt know that there is a poſſibility of admittance and entrance into that Tower: for though a man know there is ſuch a Tower, and that is a ſtrong and a ſafe Tower, yet if hee thinkes when hee comes to this Tower, that hee ſhall get no entrance, but ſhall have the Tower gates ſhut upon him, and barred againſt him, hee will never Runne to that Tower.</p>
                     <p>Now Iuſt ſo it is here.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When a man knowes God, hee knowes there is a Tower.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When hee knowes him in his attributes, hee knowes the Tower is ſufficient.</p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:233:36"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, when he knows him in Chriſt, he knows there is an entrance to be had into that tower. God out of Chriſt is a conſuming fire. And who will Run into the fire for ſafety; But hee that knowes God in Chriſt, he knowes that by Chriſt, we have acceſſe and entrance with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſſe, and acceſſe with confidence.</hi> And there is a great deale of ſafety in the knowledge of God in the knowledg of God, in his Attributes, &amp; in his Chriſt. A mans ſafety wee ſee lies in his Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Tower. <hi>He Runnes and is ſafe.</hi> And it is the knowledge of this Tower that ſets a man a Running to it. Hence wee ſhall finde ſafety attributed to the knowledge of the Lord, Pſal. 91. 14. <hi>I will ſet him on high,</hi> I will exalt him, and ſo he ſhall be ſafe. Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe hee hath known my Name,</hi> for the knowing of God a right was that which made him Run, and ſo hee is exalted, and ſet on high. Then a man is ſafe when he hath gotten this tower to be his tower, when he hath gotten God to be his God. Now when we know God, wee get him to bee our God, and make this Tower our tower.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:233:36"/> Ier. 24. 7. <hi>I will give them an Heart to know me, and I will be their God.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, an Ignorant perſon in a time or caſe of danger cannot be in expectation of ſafety, and protection: for he knowes not this Tower, he knowes not the way to this Tower. The King of Moab made a great pudder in his feare, and did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably weary himſelfe betweene his high place and his ſanctuary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 12. And why ſo? <hi>The labour of the fooliſh,</hi> of the ignorant man, <hi>wearies every one of them, becauſe</hi> hee knowes not <hi>how to goe to the city, Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 15. to the city of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, to the ſtrong Tower. Suppoſe a blinde man had ſlaine a man at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, what a caſe had hee beene in? There was no remedy, but the avenger of bloud muſt needs have diſpatcht him, becauſe hee being blinde hee knew not the way to the city of Refuge. Every Ignorant man is blinde. How can a blinde man Runne to a Tower for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when by reaſon of his blindeneſſe, he knowes not one foot of the way. And an ignorant man not knowing God in his attributes conceives him not ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient a Tower as may be truſted to. He
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:233:37"/> not knowing him in Chriſt, conceives the entrance impoſſible, and the gate ſhut againſt him, and therefore Runnes not to this Tower. As therefore wee would be able to Runne to this Tower, ſo it concernes us to know God, to know him in the attributes of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, mercy, providence, that ſo wee may Runne to him as to a Tower that wee know to bee a ſtrong Tower; And to know him in Chriſt, that wee may Runne to him as to a Tower, wee know we may have entrance into it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>I am the Dore,</hi> even Chriſt is the Dore of this Tower by whom wee muſt have entrance into it. As we would Runne, ſo know God. Knowledge is that which muſt informe us of the Tower, which muſt guide us unto the Tower, which muſt encourage and hearten us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves to this Tower. A man that will Runne muſt not onely have feet, but hee muſt have eyes. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the eyes of the ſoule by which wee muſt ſee both the Tower, and the way to it.</p>

                     <p>To Runne to this Tower is by faith to goe to God, and by it to make him our Tower for our ſafety.

                     <p>There is a great deale of ſafety in Gods Power.

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:233:41"/> that our ſafety lies in the power of God. There is a great deale of ſafetie in the providence of God; therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Secret of the moſt High, Pſalm.</hi> 91. 1. It is a ſecret privie Chamber, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 26. 20. <hi>Enter into thy Chambers.</hi> It is the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Gods Tabernacle, Pſal.</hi> 27. 5. <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his pavilion, Pſalm.</hi> 31. 20. Now what greater ſafetie than to bee within the ſecret of the moſt high? to be ſhut up within the doores of thoſe ſecret chambers? How ſafe is hee that is in the ſecret of Gods Tabernacle? Into the ſecret of the Tabernacle might none come, but the high Prieſt once a yeare, <hi>Levit:</hi> 16. 2. If a man had beene there, how ſafe had hee been from the Avenger of blood, or any other that had ſought his life? A man was ſafely lodged, that had been lodged ſo. Such a ſafetie is there under Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>There is no queſtion to be made, but there is ſafetie enough in the Name of God, in his power and providence; but all the queſtion is, how wee ſhall get within the verge, and under the ſhelter of this power, and providence. Gods
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:233:41"/> Name indeed is a tower, but how ſhall we runne into this tower? Now that is done by faith in Gods power, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: Faith is the legges and feet by which a man goes, yea runnes to God, and runnes into the tower of his power, providence, and protection. Thus did <hi>David</hi> runne to this tower, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18. 2. not onely, the Lord is <hi>a Rocke, a Buckler, a Tower,</hi> but the Lord is <hi>my Rocke, my Buckler, my high Tower.</hi> Hee makes this tower, his tower; this rocke, his rock: But how? <hi>My God, my ſtrength, in whom I will truſt.</hi> Thus by faith, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on God, he made him his tower. Truſting to God, as our tower, is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into this tower: Faith is the legges and feet of the ſoule, by which a man runnes to God, and runnes into the tower of Gods power, providence, and protection. A man cannot runne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legges and feet: He that beleeves in Gods power, and providence, he runnes to the tower, and there is ſafety in ſuch running. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> It is ſpoken in a caſe of hard times, and times of danger, when other men ſhould ſeeke to live by their wits,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:233:42"/> by their ſhifts, one by this, another by that, and yet ſhould not live neither, the juſt in ſuch times ſhould live, and ſubſiſt: But how? <hi>Hee ſhall live by his faith:</hi> he ſhall runne to God by faith, by faith he ſhall caſt himſelf, his life, eſtate, and all he hath, upon God; hee ſhall by faith, put himſelfe under Gods wings, caſt and throw himſelfe into Gods armes, and ſo making God his tower, by faith, ſhall finde ſafetie, and ſecurity from dangers, when others with all their ſhiftings and ſharkings, ſhall not ſubſiſt, but ſhall be taken and ſurprized with the dangers of thoſe times. Faith it makes God any thing a man wants; faith doth that in this life, that fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth in the life <hi>to come;</hi> there a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; that fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>God</hi> makes him all in all, makes him all that our hearts can deſire: the ſame doth faith in this life. If a man want wealth, it makes God his portion: if he want de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it makes God his Buckler; if hee want ſafetie and protection, it makes God his Tower: For by faith, relying upon his power and ſtrength, a man makes Gods power &amp; ſtrength to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:233:42"/> his exigents, and neceſſities. And hee that hath Gods power and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to be his, he is as ſafe as he that is in a ſtrong tower: and therefore it is that ſafetie is ſo frequently attributed unto faith in Scripture, <hi>Looke unto mee, and be ſaved, Iſai.</hi> 45. 22. and therefore in a caſe of temporall danger much more, run unto mee and bee ſaved. See <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>Our fathers truſted in thee, they truſted in thee, and were delivered.</hi> They were ſafe, becauſe they ranne to a ſtrong tower: But how did they run? <hi>They truſted,</hi> ſayes the Prophet, <hi>They truſted,</hi> they ranne with all their might unto this Tower by faith. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9. 9, 10. <hi>The Lord will be a refuge for the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a refuge in times of trouble.</hi> True, may ſome ſay, God is ſo indeed; but all the skill is to get into this place of Refuge, how may that bee done? See what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>And they that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> Firſt, a man muſt know this Name of GOD, and know what ſtrength and ſafetie is in it. And then when he knowes it, hee muſt truſt in it, and put himſelfe into it for his ſafetie. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37. 39, 40. There is the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:233:43"/> Tower of Gods Name, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans running to that Tower, and his ſafety by his running to it; <hi>The ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the righteous is of the Lord, hee is their ſtrength in the time of trouble;</hi> there is the Tower. <hi>The Lord ſhall helpe them and ſave them;</hi> there is the ſafety. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they truſt in him;</hi> there is the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Tower. Conſider that place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 1, 2, 3, 4. There is a ſtrong Citie, <hi>Wee have a ſtrong Citie, Salvation will God appoynt for Walles and Bulwarkes.</hi> What if a man get into that Citie? Hee ſhall be kept <hi>in perfect peace, verſ.</hi> 3. But there is no ſafetie and peace, unleſſe the gates bee opened, and a man doe enter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.

                     <p>The Lord hee is a Rocke, faith that puts us into this Rocke, and ſo wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſafe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 26. <hi>The Conies are but a feeble folke, yet make they their houſes in the Rockes.</hi> Thoſe creatures are fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fearfull creatures, and yet they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:233:43"/> ſubſiſt in multitudes. And how comes that about? Becauſe when they are purſued by dogges that are farre too ſtrong for them, they have their holds, and burrowes in the Rocke; and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into their burrowes, and into the rocke, when in danger of dogges, they are thereby kept ſafe: when once they are runne into the rockes, the dogges cannot come at them, nor meddle with them. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 104. 18. <hi>The Rockes are a refuge to the Conies.</hi> The rock, and their running to the rock, ſaves them, though but a feeble folke. It is ſo in this caſe, Gods people, it may be, are but a feeble folke, and great dangers may bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; but now God he is a Rock, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>The Lord is my Rocke.</hi> Now their wiſedome muſt be to <hi>Runne</hi> to this Rocke, and to get into it: Now faith is that by which wee muſt runne to, and burrow our ſelves in this Rocke. And if we be once burrowed in this rock, we are out of the reach of dogs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                     <p>A Dove is a poore, weake, ſilly creature; but when ſhee is purſued by the Hawke, if ſhe flyes to the rock, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:233:44"/> gets but into the holes and clefts of the Rocke, then ſhee is ſafe from the talons of the Hawke. So is it with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are ſafe in many times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but how come they to be ſafe? See <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the Rock;</hi> that is, that art hidden &amp; kept ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger of thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by Gods power and providence, as ſafe kept as a Dove is kept from the Hawke, that is gotten into the clefts of the Rocke; ſo that a mans ſafetie lies in <hi>Being</hi> in, and <hi>Dwelling</hi> in the clefts of this Rocke. But how ſhall a man get into theſe clefts, and come to dwell in them? A man muſt flye into them. Now a man cannot flye without wings. Faith therefore is the Doves wings, by which hee flies to theſe clefts, and holes in the rocke, and ſo is ſafe. It is ſayd, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 22. by God unto <hi>Moſes, I will put thee into a cleft of a rocke, and I will cover thee with mine hand, while I paſſe by.</hi> So faith in Gods power, providence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, doth put a man into the cleft of this rocke, and ſo a man is covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods hand, while dangers paſſe by: So that if a man would be ſafe, he muſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:233:44"/> doe in this caſe, as <hi>Moab</hi> is adviſed to doe in that, <hi>Ier.</hi> 48. 28. <hi>O yee that dwell in Moab, leave the Cities, and dwell in the Rocke; and bee like the Dove, that makes her neſt in the ſides of the holes mouth:</hi> So heare, O you that be in fear of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leave all carnall ſhifts, and ſharking counſels, and projects, and dwell in the Rocke of Gods power and providence, and be like the Dove that neſtles in the holes of the Rocke; by faith betake your ſelves unto God, by faith dwell in that Rock, and there neſtle your ſelves, make your neſts of ſafetie in the clefts of this Rocke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may we do this thing, and what is the way to doe it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doe theſe three things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſet thy faith on worke to make God that unto thee which thy neceſſitie requires, pitch and throw thy ſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his power and providence, with a reſolution of ſpirit to reſt thy ſelfe upon it for ſafetie, come what will come. See an excellent practice of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 1. <hi>Hee that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almightie;</hi> that is, hee ſhall bee ſafe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:233:45"/> from all feares and dangers. I that is true, you will ſay, who makes any doubt of it? But how ſhall a man come to dwell, and get into this ſecret place, within this ſtrong Tower? ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>I will ſay of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe;</hi> as if hee had ſayd, I will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, That he is a refuge: but he is my refuge, <hi>I will ſay to the Lord,</hi> that is, I will ſet my faith on worke in particular to throw, devolve, and pitch my ſelfe upon him for my ſafetie. And ſee what followes upon this ſetting faith thus on worke, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Surely hee ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler, and from the noyſome peſtilence, He ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee with his feathers,</hi> &amp;c. So confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Pſalmiſt is, that upon this courſe taken, ſafetie ſhall follow. Our ſafetie lies not ſimply upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is a Refuge, and is an Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 9, 10. <hi>Becauſe</hi> thou haſt made <hi>the Lord which is my Refuge, thine Habitation, there ſhall no evill befall thee,</hi> &amp;c. It is therefore the <hi>making</hi> of God our habitation, upon which our ſafetie lies; and this is the way to make God our habitation, thus to pitch and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:233:45"/> caſt our ſelves by faith upon his power and providence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſet thy faith on worke to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> apply, and believe the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſafetie, deliverance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; ſuch as that <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. <hi>Hee hath ſayd, I will not faile thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Such as thoſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91. and many the like elſe-where. Conſider what God hath ſayd, and what hee hath promiſed in ſuch caſes, and worke thine heart to believe thoſe ſayings, to believe thoſe promiſes, with a ſpeciall faith, as made, and directed to thy ſelfe. It is a great deale of ſafetie that may be had by this kinde of running to the Name of God.</p>
                     <p>Gods Name is a tower, the promiſes of God are the out-workes to this Tower: If a man cannot get into the Tower, yet if hee can but get into the out-workes, there is ſafetie. For as out-workes are for the ſafetie of the tower, ſo the tower is the ſafetie of the out-workes. If a man bee but in the out-workes, if they bee aſſaulted, there will be ſuccour and reliefe from the tower. If thou canſt not, as thou thinkeſt, get into God himſelfe, yet get into the out-workes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:233:46"/> of the promiſes, and there will bee ſafetie from the Tower in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes.</p>
                     <p>God, hee himſelfe is the Tower, and the <hi>Rocke,</hi> but the promiſes they are the <hi>Clefts</hi> of the Rocke. If a Dove flye to a rocke from the Hawke, yet if when ſhe come there, there bee no clefts, nor holes in the rocke, alas for the poore Dove, ſhee lies at the mercie of the Hawke. But the Dove is before hand acquainted with the clefts, and holes of the rocke, and can goe readily to them in time of danger. God is a <hi>Rocke,</hi> but now if there bee no In-lets into this rocke, if no <hi>Clefts</hi> into it, if this rock bee not opend unto us for ſafetie, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the neerer. This rocke therefore is opend unto us by the promiſes: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are the in-lets into it, they are the clefts, &amp; the holds of the rock; there is no getting into this rocke, but by the clefts. Hee therefore that would get into this rocke, muſt bee acquainted with the promiſes, and by thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by a particular faith in them, ſo get himſelfe into God. As the rocke by the holes opens it ſelfe unto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:233:46"/> and by the clefts opens it ſelfe to the Doves for ſafety: ſo God by his promiſes of protection and deliverance, opens himſelfe to us for entrance, and ſafetie. By a cleft the Dove gets into the rocke, by a promiſe believed with a ſpeciall faith, doth a man get into the rocke of Gods protection. It is good therefore for us before-hand to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rocke, and to know the clefts and in-lets thereof, by which it may be entred, and againſt, or at a time of danger, to enter them by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faith. The promiſes are the Doves lockers, particular faith in thoſe promiſes, is the making of the neſt in thoſe lockers, in the holes by the ſides of the rocke. If no rocke, no ſafetie; God hee is a Rocke. If no clefts in the rocke, no ſafetie; Gods promiſes are the clefts of the rock. If no flying unto the rocke, and neſtling in the clefts, no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; faith is the running, the flying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the neſtling in the clefts of the rocke. By faith therefore burrow thy ſelfe in theſe holes, and neſtle thy ſelfe in theſe clefts of the rocke, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſafetie.</p>

All things, that is, not onely <hi>Cephas, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. but God himſelfe, and Gods attributes, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is yours to defend you; his Power is yours to ſave you; his Mercie yours to deliver you: All yours, when Chriſt yours: wee cannot get into the Tower of Gods Providence and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, till we firſt get into Chriſt. A man that will runne to a Tower for ſafetie, muſt runne, 1. The right way, 2. To the doore of the Tower, or elſe it will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:233:50"/> bee impoſſible to get in. If a man runne, and runne a wrong way, it is impoſſible he ſhould ever come into the Tower, or if a man runne, and runne not to the doore, he cannot breake in through the Tower walles. Now therefore by faith get into Chriſt: <hi>I am the way, Ioh.</hi> 14. and that in this ſence; for no acceſſe to God, but by Chriſt. And <hi>I am the doore, Ioh.</hi> 10. and that in this ſence alſo, there being no entrance to God, but by Chriſt: ſo that by faith in Chriſt, wee runne the <hi>right way;</hi> and by faith in Chriſt, wee come to the <hi>right doore,</hi> and to have the doore opened unto us, that we may get in. Herein lies ſafetie, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>This man ſhall be the peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhal come into the land. Iſa.</hi> 32. 1, 2. Chriſt ſhall be an <hi>Hiding place from the winde, a covert from the tempeſt, as a ſhadow of a great Rock in a wearie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>land;</hi> we muſt ſeek our ſafetie in the promiſes, and all the promiſes of God are Yea, and Amen in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>And thus by faith thus uſed, wee run to this tower; and thus by this running, wee finde ſafetie. And therefore hence it is, that the ſame thing that is ſayd of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:233:50"/> God for our ſafetie, is alſo ſayd of faith. As here, and elſewhere God is called a <hi>Tower;</hi> ſo alſo is faith compared to a <hi>Tower, Cant.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Thy necke is like</hi> the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>David.</hi> By her necke is meant faith. The necke joynes the head and the body together; and ſo faith joynes Chriſt and the Church. Now this faith is like the Tower of <hi>David.</hi> God is a Tower, and faith is a Tower; and how ſo? becauſe it is faith that brings us to God, that puts us within the walles and gates of this Tower; and is that which helpes us to that ſafetie within this Tower.</p>
                     <p>God is called our <hi>Shield, Pſa.</hi> 84. 11. &amp; 91. 4. and Faith is called our <hi>Shield, Eph.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Above all things, take the</hi> Shield <hi>of Faith.</hi> God is our Shield, and Buckler, becauſe by his power hee ſhelters and defends us: Faith is our Shield, becauſe it makes God our Shield. As when a man runs to a Caſtle, and eſcapes a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we may ſay, that his caſtle, and his legges were his ſafetie. God is not a Tower to ſuch as are not towerd in their faith; hee is not a ſhield to thoſe that want the ſhield of faith. The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:233:51"/> way to have God our Tower, and our Shield, is to get the Tower and Shield of Faith.</p>
                     <p>And as wee would have ſafetie by Faith, and truſting in God, our care muſt be, not onely to get faith; but our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt bee, to increaſe and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, ſo much as poſſibly wee can.

Our endevour ſhould bee, not onely to dwell in this Rocke, but to <hi>dwell deepe:</hi> get ſuch a meaſure of faith, as that wee may get a great depth within this Rocke; make our trenches deepe, and get our ſelves deeply entrencht by faith. It is ſayd of the men of <hi>Thebez, Iudg.</hi> 9. 51. that they not onely fled into that ſtrong Tower, but that they got them <hi>up to the top of the Tower.</hi> So let us not onely run into this Tower, but get me up to the top of this Tower. This is done, when wee ſo exerciſe, and ſet our faith on worke, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:233:51"/> that we come to have confidence, and aſſurance of Gods goodneſſe to us in times of feare and danger. Faith grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong, and dayly ſet on worke on the promiſes, is getting up to the top of the tower. Tower up on high into God by the growth, and increaſe of thy faith. The higher, the ſafer. And thus we ſee how by faith wee runne to this Tower, and what ſafety there is to bee had by ſuch running.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, there is with a ſorrow for ſinne, a forſaking and caſting of it off. He that will take a right courſe for his ſafety, muſt abandon all his ſinnes, and away with them, or elſe let him runne as hee will, he were as good ſit ſtill, for he ſhall but runne in vaine, hee ſhall not get into this Tower. The way to runne, and to get in for ſafety, is a thorough forſaking of all our ſinnes and luſts. See <hi>Iſay.</hi> 33. 15. 16. <hi>He that deſpiſeth the gaine of oppreſſions, that ſhakes his hands from holding of bribes,</hi> that doth by bribes, and all unlawfull gaines, as <hi>Paul</hi> did by the viper, <hi>that ſtops his eares from hearing of bloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hee ſhall dwell on High,</hi> or in high places, <hi>His place of defence ſhall be the munition of Rockes.</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:233:52"/> Thats the way then to dwell on high, to get a defence within the munition of Rockes to purge the heart, and whole man from all our luſts, and pollutions. If a man come with the gain of oppreſſions, with his hands defiled with any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, with eares full of cruelty, eyes full of adultery, the tower gate will be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barred, and ſhut againſt ſuch an one. And when ſuch ſhall come to the tower gate, and knocke, and rap, and cry <hi>Lord Lord open unto us,</hi> the anſwer they will meet withall will be <hi>Depart ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> This gate will not be opened to workers of iniquity.

                     <p>A man that will be ſafe, muſt doe two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He muſt <hi>Runne</hi> to the Tower. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee muſt <hi>enter,</hi> and get into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Tower when runne to it. Now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, a man can doe neither of theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He cannot <hi>Runne</hi> to the Tower for ſafety without Repentance. It is in our running to this Tower for ſafety, as it is in the running of our chriſtian Race. Now how we muſt runne our chriſtian Race, ſee Heb. 12. 1. <hi>Let us runne the Race that is ſet before us.</hi> But marke what courſe muſt be firſt taken, <hi>let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſinne which doth ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſet us.</hi> If a man will runne, it is no carrying of weights on his backe: a man that will runne had not need bee ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and entangled with any thing. A man that runnes ſo, will never get the prize, ſo in this caſe. A man that will get into this Tower muſt runne, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is a ſwift, and ſpeedy motion. It is not a ſnayles pace will ſerve. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bee ſafe unleſſe wee runne,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:233:54"/> and impoſſible to runne unleſſe wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for it is impoſſible to runne if wee have <hi>weights</hi> on our backes, burthens on our ſhoulders, hamperments about our heeles, ſpecially if fetters about our legs. A fettered man will runne but ill favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, it is more then he can doe to goe well. Now all luſts and ſinnes are ſo many <hi>weights,</hi> burthens, ſo many chaines and fetters that cumber a man, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from running, <hi>let us caſt off every weight</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. So here, if yee will be ſafe ye muſt runne: if yee will runne ye muſt caſt of every <hi>weight,</hi> that is, every ſinne, every luſt that fetters and clogs you. Now repentance is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting thoſe off. So that if no repentance no caſting off weights, if no caſting off weights no running, if no running no ſafety. A man that would ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this tower muſt ſo runne to it as men in a feare, and purſuite of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, uſe to runne to caſtles and forts. Men in ſuch caſes throw away all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and carriages, they throw away their very Armes, &amp; their Garments, that they may bee light and expedite to run. Wee ſee when the Sirians were in feare
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:233:54"/> of a danger, though a falſe feare, they ſought their ſafety by their flight and running away, and wee ſee. 2 <hi>King</hi> 7. 15. <hi>All the way was full of Garments, and veſſels which the Syrians had caſt away in their haſte.</hi> Becauſe they would be ſure to runne faſt enough, veſſels and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all were flung away. If a man in the purſuite of an enemy would needs bee ſo fooliſh, as to carry a packe or a loade on his backe, and ſay with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, oh it is pitty to leave ſuch a thing behind, who would part with ſo good a thing, &amp;c. before he could reach the fort, the enemy would overtake him, and and cut him off. His luggage world hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his running and make him fall ſhort. So a man that will ſave himſelfe in this Tower muſt throw away all his lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and his baggage, muſt caſt away all his luſts, and ſinnes, which are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny burthens and weights to clog a man that hee cannot runne faſt enough, and ſoone enough to this tower for ſafety. Theſe burthens, and this baggage of our ſinnes and luſts, will inevitably expoſe us to danger. <hi>Let every one that Names the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity,</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:233:55"/> 2 Tim. 2. 19. and let every one that runs to the Name of God, and hopes to have the Name of the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> to ſet him on an high place, let him depart from Iniquity, let every one that will <hi>Runne to</hi> the Name of God, let him firſt <hi>Run from</hi> Iniquity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He cannot get into the tower with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. There is no ſafety till a man get into the tower. A man that lies, and lives in any ſinne or luſt, cannot get into the Tower, though he doe come to the Tower. The righteous man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runnes <hi>unto</hi> it, but <hi>into</hi> it, and is ſafe. So that a mans ſafety is to get into the tower. There is no getting into it ſo long as we are in our ſinnes, we muſt firſt get <hi>out</hi> of our ſinnes before we can get <hi>into</hi> the Tower. It is with getting into this, as into materiall towers and forts in time of warre. In times of warre and danger, when men betake themſelves to forts, &amp; holds, there is no man ſuffered to come into them that hath a plague ſore, or any ſuch dangerous infection. By no meanes is ſuch an one admitted to come In, or if he doe thruſt In at unawares, he is ſure to bee quickly turned out againe. So
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:233:55"/> here, if a man come to the Lord for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, if hee flye to this tower of his Name for ſafetie, and come in his luſts, and his ſinnes, and have not firſt by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance put them away, looke how many ſinnes, and how many reigning luſts hee brings, ſo many Carbuncles, and plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores he brings upon him. One plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore will keepe a man out, how much more will that man bee kept out, whoſe ſoule is as full of plague-ſores, as <hi>Iobs</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was full of boyles? If therefore wee would get into the tower, and ſo runne as to bee ſafe, firſt get wee our plague-ſores cured, and get we all our peſtilent tumors healed.</p>
                     <p>There is in repentance, as a forſaking and caſting away a mans ſinnes, and luſts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo there is a reformation, a righteous life, an obedient life, a converſation in the feare of God, a care to keepe a mans ſelfe free from the common and reigning ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the times hee lives in. This part of repentance is a running to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and ſuch a running, as wherein there is a great deale of ſafetie: and therefore wee ſhall finde ſafetie given to theſe in Scripture. There is ſafetie in <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:233:56"/> the <hi>Righteous</hi> runnes, ſayes the text, and he is ſafe. Hee muſt bee a Righteous man that runnes, and a righteous man that will looke for ſafetie. This tower wil be no ſanctuarie for unrighteous ones, but ſuch as have ſo forſaken their ſinnes, as to lead a godly life, and to walke in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they ſhall finde ſafetie in this tower, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Righteouſnes delivers from death, and in the day of wrath,</hi> which riches cannot doe.

When the fire of Gods wrath burnes and ſmoakes, it is the ſmoake of this Incenſe, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, that muſt quench the burning of Gods anger. Thus the Spirit of the Lord is that which <hi>lifts up a ſtandard</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the danger of all evils, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges his peoples hearts with a Spirit of prayer: And therefore wee ſhall ſee that prayer is not onely a <hi>meanes,</hi> but a <hi>pledge</hi> of mercie, and ſafetie comming; when God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:233:64"/> gives his people a Spirit of prayer, it is the harbinger, and fore-runner that comes with the good tidings of ſafetie and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>But I ſayd, how ſhall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleaſant land?</hi> &amp;c. As if hee had ſayd, I have thoughts and purpoſes of mercie and deliverance towards thee: It is in mine hand to deliver thee from thy cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie, and to bring thee into thine owne land againe; but what courſe ſhall I take to effect and bring it about? <hi>And I ſayd, Thou ſhalt call me, My Father.</hi> As if hee had ſayd, I have bethought my ſelfe now, of a way how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe it, I will powre down a Spirit: of Prayer upon thee, and thou ſhalt call upon mee, and call me Father; I will give thee the Spirit of Adoption, by which thou ſhalt in prayer cry, <hi>Abba</hi> Father; and ſo then I wil put thee among the children, and give thee an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſeat you in your own countrey againe. The ſumme of all is, that God would give them a Spirit of prayer, which ſhould bee not onely the meanes, but the pledge and earneſt of their deliverance. Prayer is the <hi>key</hi> of the Tower-gate. Now when <hi>God</hi> takes away the ſpirit of prayer,

And the giving of a man that key, is a pledge of Gods intentions to him for ſafety and deliverance from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and feared evils. God would never give a man a key to open the gate, if hee did not intend his entrance into the Tower.</p>
                     <p>As then wee deſire ſafetie in a caſe of feare, ſo get into this tower. Hee that would get into this tower, muſt doe two things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> hee muſt runne to it: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> hee muſt get the doore or gate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when hee comes to it. If the gate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> were open, and a man runne not to it; or if a man did runne to it; and the gate not opened, there were no ſafetie to bee had: But then there is ſafetie, when a man runnes to it, and gets the gate ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:233:65"/> ſo as alſo he may runne into it. The way to doe all theſe, is prayer: We runne to it by Prayer; Prayer is a running to this tower, and prayer is that which opens the gate. A man that would enter in at a gate, muſt either knocke at the gate, or hee muſt take the key, and unlocke it. Prayer is a <hi>knocking</hi> at the tower-gate, and ſuch a knocking, as knockes it open, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Knocke and it ſhall be opened unto you,</hi> which is the ſame with that, <hi>Aske, and it ſhall be given unto you.</hi> Prayer is the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the key, and the unlocking of the gate. It is ſayd of the Angell, and <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. 10. that when they came to the <hi>Iron gate, that led into the Citie, it opened unto them of its owne accord.</hi> Looke what the Angell was to <hi>Peter,</hi> that is prayer to a man comming to the gate of the tower; the gate of the tower will <hi>open of it owne accord</hi> to a man that comes with prayer. Let a man therefore in his feares, betake himſelfe to this dutie of ſeeking God, as to a courſe of ſafetie, <hi>Runne</hi> to the tower by prayer, <hi>Knocke</hi> at the gate by prayer, <hi>unlocke</hi> the doore, and get entrance by prayer, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 20. 7, 8. <hi>Some their Charets, and ſome their horſes, but wee will remember</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:233:65"/> 
                        <hi>the Name of the Lord our God, They are brought downe, and fallen, but wee are riſen, and ſtand upright.</hi> There is more ſafetie in <hi>Remembring the Name of the Lord,</hi> than in Charets and Horſes: They that put their ſafety in their Charets, and their Horſes, may come downe, and fall low enough, but they that remember the name of the Lord, they riſe, and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. It is a mans ſafeſt courſe then by farre, to <hi>Remember</hi> the name of the Lord. But what is it to <hi>Remember</hi> the name of the Lord? That is, by prayer to runne to the Lord, <hi>Ion.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>When my ſoule faynted within me,</hi> I remembred <hi>the Lord.</hi> That courſe <hi>Ionah</hi> tooke in the feares and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Spirit, to <hi>remember</hi> the Lord. But what meanes hee by Remembring the Lord? that hee ſhewes in the words following. <hi>And my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy Temple.</hi> Prayer then is the <hi>Remembring</hi> the name of the Lord, and <hi>Remembring</hi> the Name of the Lord is the courſe of ſafety. Remembring the Name of the Lord is Running to the Tower of Gods Name, and hee that Runnes into it he is ſafe. And yet how little is this courſe thought upon by men in their feares! E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:233:66"/> thing is done, but that which ſhould be done, and that is laſt done, if done at all, which ſhould be firſt done. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tels them, Iſay 22. 5. of a ſad day that was comming upon them, <hi>a day of trouble and perplexity, of breaking downe the walles, and crying to the mountaines.</hi> And what courſe take they? <hi>They looke in that day to the armour of the houſe of the Forreſt,</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>They veiw the breaches of the city, and breake downe houſes to fortifie the wall,</hi> verſ. 9. 10. But all this while no <hi>looking to God</hi> from whom the evill came, nor ſeeking unto him who could defend them from that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, verſ. 11.

That is the folly and madneſſe of men, to neglect this courſe which ſo much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to their ſafety. Looke wee to God,

In running there is more putting out of a mans ſelfe, and his ſtrength, then in the ordinary pace of Going. There is more vehemency and earneſtneſſe required in running, then in a walking pace. A man ſhould doe in praying, as he would doe in running from an enemy to a fort, or tower. A man in danger of an enemy would not walke an eaſie pace but would runne, and runne with all his might that hee could. And ſo ſhould men pray, that would by prayer runne into this Tower. It muſt be prayer in which men muſt put out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt, it muſt be done with all vehemency, and contention of Spirit. It is not verball and formall praying will ſerve the turne, that is not ſo much as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and walking, much leſſe is it running. A mans tongue may runne in prayer, but it is no running to God, unleſſe a mans heart, and all his affections are at the work with all their might: that the king of <hi>Nineveh</hi> knew, and therefore when hee heares of the danger they were in, hee preſſes his ſubjects not onely to prayer,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:233:69"/> but to <hi>crying</hi> prayer. He ſaies not, let men pray, but <hi>let men cry,</hi> nor that onely, but <hi>let men cry mightily</hi> unto God. <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 8. Hee ſaw that if there were any hope of ſafety by running into this Tower, that it muſt bee by running with all their might: if there were any helpe for them by prayer, it muſt bee by earneſt inſtant vehement prayer. It is one thing to <hi>ſay</hi> a prayer, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to <hi>pray</hi> a prayer. Iam. 5. 17. <hi>Elias prayed in his prayer,</hi> as the words are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the margine of the New tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. It is tranſlated, he <hi>prayed earneſtly.</hi> Then a man prayes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, when he prayes in his prayer. That may be a prayer <hi>materially,</hi> which <hi>formally</hi> is no prayer, and a man may have a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and uſe a prayer, and yet not <hi>pray in his prayer.</hi> When hee prayes onely with his tongue, is onely verball, and formall, hee prayes not in his prayer. <hi>Formall</hi> prayer is not prayer <hi>Formally,</hi> becauſe that which gives forme and being to prayer, is that a man <hi>pray in his prayer.</hi> And that is done when prayer is inſtant, earneſt, fervent. And ſuch prayer it is that is <hi>effectuall,</hi> that <hi>prevailes much. Jam.</hi> 1. 16. when a man prayes in his prayer, ſuch prayer is ſuch a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:233:70"/> running as will be effectuall, and prevaile much to get a man into, and to keepe him ſafe in this Tower. The way to prevaile with men from whom we feare danger, is to take a courſe firſt to prevaile with God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. <hi>Thou haſt power with God, and with men, and haſt prevayled:</hi> that is, thou haſt had power with God, and haſt prevayled with him, thou ſhalt therefore alſo have Power with men, and prevaile with them. But how came he to prevaile with God? <hi>Iacob wreſtled</hi> with him, as wee ſee in the ſtory. And what was a ſpeciall thing in that wreſtling wee ſhall ſee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3. 4. <hi>By his ſtrength hee had Power with God.</hi> That was one way by which hee had power with God. <hi>By his ſtrength,</hi> by the ſtrength of his faith. But there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, verſ. 4. <hi>Yea he had Power over the Angel, and prevailed, he wept and made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto him.</hi> He prevailed by prayer, but it was not perfunctory, and formall prayer, but it was wreſtling and weeping prayer, inſtant and earneſt prayer. <hi>Hee wept and made ſupplication.</hi> Some in their dangers and feares can weepe, their feares wring teares from them, but it is not teares will prevaile without prayers. And ſome
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:233:70"/> may pray, and make ſupplication, but it is not prayers without teares will prevaile, <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Teares,</hi> weeping prayers, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſupplications are the prevayling prayers for ſafety: wreſtling prayers are preuayling prayers with God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayling with God is the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with men. So did <hi>Iacob</hi> runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this tower, and was ſafe. Theſe prayers and teares ſo prevayled that <hi>Eſau</hi> inſteed of <hi>killing</hi> falles to <hi>kiſſing</hi> of <hi>Iacob.</hi> The king that is not able with his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to meet with him that comes againſt him with twenty thouſands, whileſt his Adverſary is yet a great way off, <hi>ſends an Ambaſſage, and deſires conditions of Peace,</hi> Luke 14. 31, 32. Now in caſes of feares and danger, our prayers to God are <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for peace,</hi> and ſafety. Now as theſe <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> act their cauſe ſuch is our ſpeede If theſe Agents doe their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe coldly, and onely for forme, there is little peace and ſafety to be hoped for by their Ambaſſage. But if wee would have peace and ſafety by their Embaſſy, they muſt goe to worke as thoſe, Iſa. 33. 7. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their meſſengers ſhall cry without, the ambaſſadours of peace ſhall weepe bitterly.</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:233:71"/> The meſſengers muſt cry, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours weepe, and weepe bitterly, that will prevaile for peace, and ſafety, from danger. Their earneſtneſſe, vehemency, fervency, and their teares, theſe muſt bee the rhetoricke and oratory, by which they muſt prevaile Prayer is running unto God, but <hi>ſo Runne</hi> that yee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>ſo pray</hi> that ye may prevaile for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So pray, with ſuch inſtance, with ſuch fervency, with ſuch earneſt contention of ſpirit, as that ye may finde entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this tower, God was <hi>Davids</hi> Tower, and thus hee uſed to get into this tower, not onely by prayer, but by this earneſt prayer, he prayed as men uſe to runne in caſe of danger, with all his ſtrength, Pſal. 61. 3. <hi>Thou haſt beene my ſtrong Tower, from the enemy,</hi> and ſo I hope thou wilt bee ſtill, what courſe takes hee to get into that tower? verſ. 1. <hi>Heare my cry O God,</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>from the ends of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Hee runnes to the Tower not onely by prayer, but by earneſt, and <hi>crying</hi> prayer, Pſal. 119. 145. 146. <hi>I cryed with my whole heart,</hi> I ranne to the Tower with all my might, and force, <hi>I cryed unto thee, ſave me.</hi> It is <hi>crying</hi> prayer, that is <hi>ſaving</hi> prayer. <hi>Knocke, and it ſhall be</hi>

                        <hi>opened unto you,</hi> Matth. 7. A man purſued by an enemy, running to a tower, if hee finde the gate ſhut, how knockes he? Hee knockes as loud, as hee can, hee knockes with all his might, knockes and beates at the doore, as if hee would beate the doore open. His life lies upon it, and therefore he knockes not gently, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, but layes on with all his might.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muſt be <hi>Conſtant,</hi> elſe no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſafety by it. A man purſued by an enemy if hee will bee ſafe, muſt not onely runne for a while, and ſome little part of the way, but he muſt hold on Running till he comes to the Tower. If he runne for ſome time, and then growes weary, and out of breath, and ſo ſtands ſtill, or ſits him downe: an enemy may eaſily overtake and ſurpriſe him before hee can get into the Tower. It is not ſimply running in which a mans ſafety lies, but in running into the Tower. And how is hee like to runne into the tower, that holds not out running till he come to the Tower? Hee that ſtands ſtill, ſits downe, and ceaſes his running pace, may eaſily be cut off before hee get into the Tower. Our ſafety lies much upon our conſtancy in ſeeking God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:233:72"/> by prayer. <hi>So runne that ye may obtaine</hi> ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by running, that is, runne conſtantly, and hold on in prayer without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſloathfulneſſe. Iacob not onely wreſtled, but hee wreſtled all night, and would not let the Angel goe till hee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. He did not wreſtle about or two and then give over, but he held out wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſo prevayled againſl Eſau, and was fafe from him. It muſt bee <hi>conſtant</hi> as well as <hi>Inſtant</hi> prayer, by which wee muſt get into the Tower. <hi>Knocke and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> A man that will get into the Tower, muſt knocke at the gate, and as he muſt knocke inſtantly, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, ſo hee muſt knocke on, and not ceaſe knocking, till the doore be opend. Hee muſt knocke as <hi>Peter</hi> knockt at the doore, of <hi>Maries</hi> houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Hee knocked at the doore of the gate,</hi> and though they doe not preſently open, yet he gives not over knocking, but verſ. 16. <hi>Peter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued knocking,</hi> and then the doore was opened. David ioyned both together in his prayers, <hi>Inſtancy</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy, Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. <hi>Evening and Morning, and at noone will I pray; and cry aloud.</hi> Hee would pray, and cry, yea, and cry aloud. Hee was <hi>Inſtant.</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:233:72"/> Hee would not doe it once or twice, and then ſet downe and lay it aſide, but <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, Morning and at Noone,</hi> hee would bee aſſiduous in the duty, every day hee would make it his mornings worke, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings worke, and his noones worke to. And he would hold out, and not faint, nor throw up, but this courſe hee would goe on in, till the Lord ſhould heare his voice. He was conſtant, and why would he hold on this conſtantly in this duty? Becauſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Hee hath delivered my ſoule in peace, from the battell that was againſt me.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I have heretofore beene in great dangers. In thoſe dangers I earneſtly, and conſtantly ſought God by prayer. I ranne unto the Tower of his Name, and I was exalted, and found ſafety: and therefore I will now doe ſo againe, I will pray and cry aloud, I will pray inſtantly, I will pray evening, morning, and at noone, I will pray conſtantly. The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the Righteous runnes into it, want <hi>hath Runne,</hi> or doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times runne, but <hi>he Runnes,</hi> hee is alwayes running, hee makes it his conſtant worke, he goes on ſetledly in that courſe, and ſo is exalted. And ſo much forth is fourth thing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:233:73"/> in which this running conſiſts, and for the firſt point alſo. The doing of thoſe duties by which wee may get into this Tower.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Second</hi> generall point, is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of doing all theſe duties, which is a ſpeciall requiſite for the procuring of ſafety. And that manner of Doing them is implyed in this word <hi>Runnes.</hi> The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>walkes</hi> not, <hi>goes</hi> not, they are but ſlow motions, but he <hi>Runnes.</hi> Running is a motion of ſpeed, a motion of haſt. <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> commands his lad ſaying, <hi>Run find out now the Arrowes that Iſhoot,</hi> and ſhooting an arrow beyond him, he cryed after the lad, <hi>Make ſpeed, haſt, ſtay not.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 36. 38. That is to Runne, to make ſpeed, to haſte, and not to ſtay. The Righteous man then runnes to the Tower, that is, he doth not onely uſe all theſe forenamed meanes, and take thoſe courſes for his ſafety, but he ſets upon them with ſpeed, and makes haſte to the uſe of them. He not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, but hee makes haſt to ſet his faith on worke, Hee not onely repents, but he ſpeedily, and quickely goes about that buſineſſe, hee out of hand in the firſt apprehenſions of danger, ſets upon the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:233:73"/> humbling of his ſoule, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his wayes, and walking in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God. Hee not onely betakes himſelfe to prayer, but doth it preſently and without delaying, ſets upon the courſe that may make for his ſafety. <hi>He Runnes,</hi> hee ſpeedily ſets this courſe on foot, for feare of being too late, and leaſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould overtake him before hee bee Towerd. So that hee that will goe wiſely to worke, muſt take theſe courſes ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As in that caſe the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 Corinthians 9. <hi>So Runne that yee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,</hi> ſo in this, ſo Runne that yee may obtaine ſafety. So it is, <hi>ſo haſtily, ſo ſpeedily, ſo quickely.</hi> Running is a ſwift, ſpeedy, and an accelerated motion of the body. So ſhould a man that ſeekes ſafety goe to this Tower, as <hi>Lot</hi> went to <hi>Zoar,</hi> Geneſ. 19. 22. <hi>Haſte thee, eſcape thither.</hi> Implying that his <hi>eſcape did not</hi> onely lie in going out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> nor in going unto <hi>Zoar,</hi> but in his <hi>Haſte</hi> from the one, and in his Haſte to the other, <hi>as if no Haſte, no eſcape.</hi> When the plague was broken out in the campe of Iſrael, Numbers 16. 46. 47. <hi>Goe quickly,</hi> ſaies <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> goes, and marke how he goes.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:233:74"/> 
                        <hi>He ranne into the middeſt of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That ſhould be our pace for our owne ſafety, which was his pace for the ſafety of others. <hi>A quicke running pace.</hi> Thats the pace that men purſued by an enemy uſe, feare is as wings to their bodies, they runne full ſpeed to a fort, where they may get ſhelter. Ier. 48. 28. <hi>O ye that dwell in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab leave the cities, and dwell in the Rocke, and be like the dove,</hi> &amp;c. now how goes the dove to the Rocke when ſhee is purſued by the hawke? See by that Iſay 60. 8. <hi>who are thoſe that</hi> fly <hi>as a cloud, and as the</hi> doves <hi>to their windowes.</hi> A dove is naturally ſwift of flight, ſwift of wing, no foule ſwifter, but ſpecially ſhe flies ſwift when ſhee flies for her life. Her ordinary flight is like the cloudes, but feare makes her flight ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus <hi>David</hi> when he ſaw a ſtorme and a tempeſt comming, he doth not only wiſh wings to fly away, and to eſcape it, but he wiſhes <hi>doves wings,</hi> Pſ. 55. 6. <hi>Oh that I had</hi> wings like a dove, <hi>for then would I flee away and be at reſt, I would</hi> haſten <hi>mine eſcape from the windy ſtorme, and tempeſt.</hi> As if no way to eſcape a ſtorme, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt but with a <hi>doves wings.</hi> It is not any wings, they muſt be doves wings that muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:233:74"/> doe it: the ſwifteſt wing is needfull in ſuch a caſe. It muſt be a Doves wing, and a Doves ſwift flight that muſt get into the holes, and clefts of the rock. A mans eſcape lies upon a Doves wings: and ſure it is, that our ſafetie lies not more in the duties doing, than in this manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſpeed. <hi>Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies,</hi> I flye <hi>unto thee to hide me, Pſal.</hi> 143. 9. A man that would be ſafe from enemies, and the danger of them, his ſafetie indeed lies in being hid with God, in being hid in that Tower; but yet he that wil be hid in it, muſt take a courſe to get into it: Hee muſt runne into that Tower, hee muſt flye to God, <hi>I flye unto thee to hide me.</hi> Running is a ſwift pace, but flying is a ſwifter motion. As God hath <hi>Wings</hi> for <hi>ſafety</hi> and ſhelter, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91. 4. ſo muſt a man have <hi>wings</hi> for <hi>ſpeed</hi> and <hi>ſwiftneſſe,</hi> that will make his refuge under the ſhadow of thoſe wings: and there is great reaſon of making <hi>ſpeed</hi> and haſte in the worke.</p>
                     <p>Delayes are dangerous in caſes of this nature. As ſoone as ever <hi>Moſes</hi> knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that wrath was gone out from the Lord, and that the plague was begun, hee bids
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:233:75"/> 
                        <hi>Aaron goe quickly;</hi> and <hi>Aaron runnes</hi> with all the ſpeed he can, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. and yet all this ſpeed notwithſtanding, there dye fourteene thouſand, and ſeven hundred of the plague, before <hi>Aaron</hi> could make attonement, and quench the fire. What if <hi>Aaron</hi> had ſtayd till next day, till the next weeke? What if hee had ſlighted the danger? Tuſh, the plague is but now begun, it may bee it may prove nothing; it may bee, after a few dayes it may ceaſe againe, let us try a little while, and firſt ſee what it will doe, and if it doe riſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny height, then I will take the cenſer, and make attonement. If hee had thus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowed, and delayed the time, what a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing had it beene to Iſrael? Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had been in danger to have been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up with the plague; and where one dyed, there might have died a thouſand. <hi>Aarons</hi> delay had been Iſraels preſent death. When Gods wrath is once out, and once up, it haſtens, and makes quick and ſpeedie executions, it diſpatches men apace; and if they have not made haſte to get themſelves within the tower, that will make haſte to deſtroy them. The two women that did lift up the <hi>Ephah,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:233:75"/> 
                        <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 9. they had wings, the wings of a Storke, and the winde was in their wings; to ſhew the haſte and ſpeed with which that judgement ſhould be executed. The wrath of God, when it breakes out, may bee named as that childe was, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz,</hi> It makes <hi>ſpeed to the ſpoyle, it haſtens the prey.</hi> And therefore in caſe men make not haſte into this tower, they are but undone, and gone men. It was wiſe counſell the Egyptians gave <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Let the people goe, wilt thou firſt know that Egypt is deſtroyed?</hi> As if they had ſayd, Danger, and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is towards us, let us not delay to take a courſe for our ſafetie, and put it off till it will bee too late, till wee bee deſtroyed: And their courſe and practiſe afterwards was a wiſe courſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 33. <hi>And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might ſend them out of the land</hi> in haſte; <hi>for they ſayd, Wee are all dead men.</hi> They ſaw they were all in danger of death, if they did not haſten to take a courſe for their ſafetie, and therefore they are <hi>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> to ſend away the people <hi>in haſte.</hi> Haſte, ſayes the Proverbe, makes waſte; but here it is otherwiſe, haſte prevents
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:233:76"/> waſte, and want of haſte makes waſte. It was <hi>Lots</hi> fault, that <hi>hee lingred</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>And whileſt he lingered,</hi> he made not the haſte hee ſhould have done; loath he is to leave <hi>Sodom,</hi> and how much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his lingring and delaying expoſed him unto, the text implies, <hi>Whileſt hee lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, the men layd hold upon his hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lord being mercifull unto him, and they brought him forth, and ſet him without the Citie.</hi> The words imply, that if the Lord had not made more <hi>haſte</hi> than hee did, and if hee had not ſnatcht him as a brand out of the fire, he had lingred till the fire and brimſtone had been about his eares. It is a very dangerous thing then to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not to runne, and make haſte to this Tower.</p>
                     <p>It is a great deale of ſafetie that is in the ſpeedy doing of theſe duties: Our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> proverbe is, <hi>The more haſte, the worſe ſpeed;</hi> but here it is contrary, the more haſte, the better ſpeed: the more haſte, the more ſafetie. When <hi>Abigail,</hi> and her familie, was in danger of <hi>David,</hi> that hee had ſworne the deſtruction of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and all his familie; ſo ſoone as ſhe is informed of the danger, ſhee takes a courſe to prevent
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:233:76"/> it: the Text ſayes, ſhe was a woman of a <hi>good underſtanding;</hi> and as ſhee ſhewed herſelfe to be ſo in other things, ſo in this one thing, as much as any, that ſhee goes ſpeedily about a courſe of ſafetie, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 18. <hi>Then Abigail</hi> made haſte, <hi>and tooke two hundred loaves,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>And when Abigail ſaw David, ſhe haſted,</hi> &amp;c. And ſee what ſhe got by it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>For in very deed, as the Lord God of Iſrael lives, which hath kept me backe from hurting thee,</hi> except thou hadſt haſted, <hi>and come to meet mee, ſurely there had not been left unto Nabal,</hi> &amp;c. He ſayes not, except thou hadſt come to meet me; but <hi>except thou hadſt haſted,</hi> and come to meet me; ſhee might have come to meet him, and have met him too late. As if hee had ſayd, thou mayeſt thanke thine haſtening to meet mee: thine haſte hath been thy ſafetie. If therfore a man in the apprehenſion of danger, have any provident thoughts for his owne ſafetie, let him not onely take the courſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but let him doe it with ſpeed. As Chriſt ſayd to <hi>Iudas</hi> in that, ſo ſay I to thee in this caſe, <hi>That thou doeſt, doe quickly,</hi> the <hi>ſooner</hi> the <hi>ſafer.</hi> It is great wiſedome to ſend Embaſſadours of peace, whileſt the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:233:77"/> adverſarie is <hi>yet a great way off, Luke</hi> 14. 32. If a danger and a feare bee remote, and farre of, it is good to provide with the ſooneſt for ſafety. It is the faſhion of the Spaniard, if hee ſees a fray at the further end of the ſtreet, though it bee an whole ſtreets length off him, yet to draw his weapon preſently: he will be ſure to look to one, and will not bee to ſeeke for his ſafetie if the danger ſhould draw nigher him. So if wee ſee the Lord drawing, and unſheathing the ſword of his wrath in the Peſtilence, or any other judgement, take a courſe preſently for ſafetie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be betaking thy ſelfe to the tower: though the danger ſeeme to bee farre off; ſpecially doe it, if the danger be <hi>neere you, at the doores, Matth.</hi> 24. 33. Mens ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and love of the world ſo beſots them commonly, that they are not ſo ſenſible, and apprehenſive of dangers as they ſhould be; and therefore no haſte with them but good. If they goe towards the tower, it is at the beſt but a foot pace; yea but a ſnayles pace, they walke on <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely,</hi> and <hi>lingringly;</hi> they doe not runne full ſpeed, as if their ſafetie lay in their ſpeed; whileſt men want the Doves
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:233:77"/> wings it is an adventure whether ever they will get under Gods wings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third</hi> and laſt generall poynt is, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doing of ſuch duties which are to be done when entred and gotten into the tower, and they are theſe two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Have a care to keep our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Tower; being once gotten under Gods protection, have a care to walke cloſe, and to keepe cloſe to him: Take heed of ſtragling out of this Tower. A man that was gotten into a Citie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, was ſafe from the danger of bloud, ſo long as hee kept himſelfe within the walles of the Citie; but if hee thinking his confinement too ſtreight, and his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too ſtrict, would bee adventuring to take ſome libertie, and to goe abroad; if the avenger of bloud found him abroad, he might then ſlay him without any guilt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 26, 27, 28. <hi>If the ſlayer ſhall at any time come without the border of the Citie of his refuge, whither he was fled, and the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood finde him</hi> without the borders <hi>of the Citie of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the ſlayer, hee ſhall not bee guiltie of blood, becauſe he ſhould</hi> have remained <hi>in the Citie of his Refuge, untill the death of the</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:233:78"/> 
                        <hi>high Prieſt.</hi> So a man that is gotten into this Tower, under Gods protection, is ſafe and ſure, ſo long as hee keepes him. But if he thinke thoſe courſes too ſtrict in which he muſt walke, to keep himſelfe under that ſhelter, and will adventure to ſtep out, and take ſome libertie that God allowes not, hee being out of the borders of the Tower, if he meet with a clap, and come ſhort, hee may thanke himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhould have <hi>remained</hi> within the trenches and walls of the Tower. <hi>In the</hi> ſhadow of thy wings <hi>will I make my refuge, untill theſe calamities be paſt, Pſal.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>Hee ſhall cover thee with</hi> his feathers, <hi>and under</hi> his wings <hi>ſhalt thou truſt, Pſalm.</hi> 91. 4. How ſafe is the Chickin under the Hens wing? but if the Chickin will bee wandring, and going out, then no wonder if ſhe become a prey to the Kite, ſoone may the Chickin bee in the <hi>Kites Clawes,</hi> when ſhee is from under the <hi>Hennes wing.</hi> That therefore muſt bee a mans ſpeciall care, when once he is gotten under Gods wing, to keepe cloſe to him, and to walke cloſe with him. If wee will be too bold to give our ſelves unallowd liberties, looke not for ſafety in ſuch a courſe.</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:233:78"/>
                     <p> When men have a ſtrong hold, and Caſtle, yet they ſo truſt not to it, but they keep watch and ward. If they within the tower ſhould grow ſecure, and negligent, eſpecially if they ſhould fall to drinking, and drunkenneſſe, how eaſily might an adverſary without ſurprize them, and turn them out of their hold, or put them to the ſword? A man gotten into the Tower of Gods Name, muſt keepe his watch in the tower: if wee grow ſecure, and looſe, we cannot expect aſſurance of our ſafetie; our ſafetie lies very much upon our watchfulneſſe over our owne hearts and wayes, after that we be gotten into this tower.</p>
                     <p>Being within the Tower, have a care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to improve the ſtrength of the Tower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enemies, to make uſe of it againſt them. As in the Scriptures there be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for a mans owne ſafetie; ſo there be be alſo threatnings for the ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Gods enemies. And as wee muſt ſet our faith and prayer on worke upon the promiſes of ſafetie and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for our ſelves: ſo muſt wee ſet our faith and prayer on worke upon the threatnings againſt enemies.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undertakes the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of two great evils which were it ſeemes too common amongſt thoſe Chriſtian Iews, to whom he writes this Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was that mentioned, verſ. 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:233:86"/> Their having of the faith of Chriſt with reſpect of perſons. In reproving of which he continues to the end of the thirteenth verſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond evill was that, mentioned verſ. 14. A vaine boaſting of faith, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> no ſuch thing was to bee found. A boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of a fruitleſſe and a barren faith. A faith that would eate, and yet would not worke. A faith that would bee ſaved, and yet did not manifeſt it ſelfe in ſuch things, and fruites as accompany ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hee therefore tels them plainely, that ſuch a barren idle faith was no ſaving faith. And this hee proves unto them by divers arguments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from a compariſon of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> equals. There is the ſame reaſon of faith and charity. Now Charity that ſpeakes kindely, and gives good words, and yet ſtretches not out the hand to ſuccour, and relieve the wants of ſuch as are in Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it is a Dead Charity. So is the caſe with faith. This is laid downe, verſe 15. 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken from the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the manifeſtation of faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fruites of it. Faith where ever it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:233:86"/> is, may bee, and will be manifeſted. It is with faith, as it was with Chriſt. He could not be hid.</p>
                  <p>A Faith that can keep houſe, and skulk, and lye cloſe is not a right bred Faith, verſ. 18.</p>
                  <p>The third is taken from an Abſurdity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It were an abſurd thing that a Chriſtian ſhould have no better a faith, then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell have. And ſuch a faith may they have. verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is taken from an Adjunct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Privation. Becauſe ſuch a faith as is without workes is a <hi>Dead Faith.</hi> How can hee bee a living Chriſtian whoſe Faith is Dead? That is laid downe verſ. 20. How can a Dead Faith bring a man to life.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is taken from a compariſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from the leſſe. Becauſe ſuch a faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Iuſtifie. If not Iuſtifie, then not ſave. If not the leſſe, then not the greater. And this argument he illuſtrates by two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Rahab.</hi> In the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there be theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He layes downe his propoſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:233:87"/> faith, verſ. 21. For that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe words, and the Apoſtle by workes underſtands faith, which hath workes, as appeares by that, verſ. 18. Thou haſt faith, it is a naked and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty faith without workes. I have workes, that is, faith which breakes forth, and manifeſts it ſelfe in workes: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaies that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Iuſtified by workes, he meanes, that his faith, by which hee was juſtified, was not a naked faith empty of workes. That hand of faith by which hee laid hold on Chriſt, as it was an apprehending, and an applying hand, ſo was it an acting, and a working hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he proves that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by which he was juſtified, was not a faith which did not worke, by the offering of his ſonne, verſ. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hee cals ſuch vaine boaſters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to a ſerious conſideration of what hee had ſaid. <hi>Seeſt thou not how faith, &amp;c.</hi> And two things hee would have them conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith did worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> together with his workes. That his workes did flow from the principle of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:233:87"/> faith, and that his faith did concurre unto his workes, that they might bee right, and pleaſing to God, <hi>for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes 11. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That his faith was made <hi>perfect</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by his workes. That is, by theſe workes of his it was clearely manifeſted that his faith was a lively, true, and perfect faith, verſ. 22.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hee concludes that which he had laid downe at firſt, That <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> was juſtified not by an idle, but by a lively working faith. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he proves by a teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, verſ. 23. The teſtimony is taken from <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. for by the workes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> it appeares that faith, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> there ſpake was not a ſloathfull, but a working faith. And that faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> hee ſets forth by another conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that followed upon it beſides that which is ſpecified in the Teſtimony of Scripture, for take the words toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is ſet forth by two ſpeciall things that followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was his Iuſtification. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond was, the favour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> friendſhip of God. <hi>And hee was called the friend of God.</hi> Hee was called, that is, hee was, and became the friend of God. So Matthew 5. 9. <hi>Bleſſed are the peace-makers, for they ſhall bee</hi> called <hi>the ſonnes of God,</hi> that is, they ſhall be the ſons of God.</p>

                  <p> This is not every ones portion to have a ſhare in ſuch Honour, and favour. Look upon men in their naturall condition, and they are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to God, and God a <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> to them, there is no acquaintance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and them. <hi>They are</hi> ſtrangers <hi>as from the Life of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. ſo <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the covenants of promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. and ſtrangers to God himſelfe, for both goe there together, <hi>ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, and without God in the world.</hi> They are born ſtrangers, Pſal. 58. 3. <hi>The wicked are</hi> eſtranged <hi>from the wombe.</hi> And ſo they live ſtrangers, there is no more familiarity, and acquaintance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and them, then is betweene ſtrangers that never ſaw, or heard each of other. God is ſuch a ſtranger to them, that if hee doe offer them any manner of acquaintance, they ſhake him off as a ſtranger, <hi>Iob.</hi> 20. 14. 15. <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us, for wee deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes, what is the Almighty?</hi> They uſe him as a ſtranger, they wiſh him to bee gone, they care not for, nor deſire his acquaintance, they deſire to bee ridde of him. And therefore God carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a very ſtranger to them. And as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:233:89"/> men are not well pleaſed, when ſtrangers are brought into their houſes, whom they know not who, nor what, nor whence they are: ſo is God highly diſpleaſed, when ſuch perſons are brought into his houſe, and that becauſe they be ſtrangers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 7. <hi>Yee have brought into my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> ſtrangers, <hi>uncircumciſed in heart.</hi> God had as lieve have their roome as their company, as we uſe to ſay of meere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to us: Such is the condition of men by nature. But contrarily of the faithfull it may be ſaid, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Now therefore yee are no more forrayners and ſtrangers.</hi> What are they then? not onely as their fellowes; <hi>But fellow citizens,</hi> &amp;c. But they are more, they are the friends, and acquaintance, the beloved friends, and favourites of God.</p>
                  <p>Nay, look upon men in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and they are in a worſe condition then ſtrangers. It is condition bad enough to bee ſtrangers, to have no acquaintance with God, but it is worſe to bee Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to have God our enemy, and to be enemies to him. And that is the caſe of a man in his naturall condition, God and hee are enemies: Therefore the Apoſtle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:233:90"/> inſtances in both. Coloſ. 1. 21. <hi>You that were alienated, and enemies,</hi> you were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but thats not All: yee were worſe, you were enemies to God, you hated God and God hated you, you oppoſed God, and God oppoſed you, there were hoſtile affections, diſpoſitions, and carriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and you, ſuch was your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition. And that is the miſery of naturall men, they are Gods enemies: but this is the honour, and happineſſe of the godly, that they are the friends of God. There is no relation betweene God and his, but there is honour &amp; happineſſe in it. Sometimes they are called his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he their God. To be Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſubjects, is an honourable and happy thing, Pſal. 144. 15. <hi>Happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> It is an happy thing to be Gods people. <hi>For they are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nigh unto him.</hi> Pſal. 148. 14. Sometimes they are called the ſervants of God. It is an honourable and happy thing to be Gods ſervants. <hi>Happy are thy ſervants,</hi> ſaies the Queene of Sheba, of <hi>Salomons</hi> ſervants 1 King. 10. 8. And if an happineſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Salomons,</hi> how much more in being Gods ſervants? <hi>David</hi> ſeemes to count it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:233:90"/> more honour to write himſelfe, <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord,</hi> than the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> All friendſhip ſtands in <hi>Communion:</hi> there is a great deale of ſweetneſſe, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contentment in a friend, by reaſon of communion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Oyntment and perfume rejoyce the heart, ſo doth the</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>of a mans friend, by heartie counſell.</hi> The communion that is between friends, is an <hi>Oyntment,</hi> and a <hi>Perfume</hi> that rejoyces
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:233:91"/> the heart. And when a man findes a true friend, hee findes hony, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 16. <hi>Haſt thou found honey?</hi> that is, haſt thou found a friend? But why ſayes he, <hi>Haſt thou found honey?</hi> Becauſe of the <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> that is in communion with a friend. <hi>What is ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than honey? Judg.</hi> 14. 18. Nothing ſweeter than honey to a mans taſte, and nothing ſweeter than a perfume to a mans ſmell: and a friend hath the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of both, of <hi>Honey,</hi> and a <hi>Perfume.</hi> Now the godly having God for their friend, they have communion with him, ſweet communion with him, ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their communion with this their friend, as is above the ſweetneſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſuch as rejoyces the heart above all oyntment and perfume. Looke what communion is between heartie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire friends, ſuch there is in all poynts between God and the faithfull, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their friendſhip between God and them. Communion between friends, ſtands commonly in theſe things:</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Communication of their ſecrets</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> each to other. A man will let his friend know his greateſt ſecrets, wil make knowne his minde to him in his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:233:91"/> ſecrets. Indeed to a ſtranger, with whom a man hath little or no familiaritie and friendſhip, or to one from whom his heart is alienated, and eſtranged, a man will not communicate his ſecrets, no not common and triviall matters, that are but matters of ordinary courſe. But where there is friendſhip, and inward intireneſſe, there the boſome ſecrets are diſcloſed and imparted: the very ſecret cabinet is unlockt and ſet open, for a friend to look into; friends have all things common, common ſecrets, <hi>Iob.</hi> 19. 19. <hi>All my inward friends abhorred me.</hi> The words are, <hi>All the</hi>

Thus is it betweene God and the faithfull, being once his friends, he will have ſweet communion with them, in revealing, diſcloſing, and

It is ſome favour and priviledge to bee of the Kings <hi>Court;</hi> but it is a farre greater to bee of the Kings <hi>Counſell.</hi> Courtiers they know ſomewhat more than thoſe that live in the remote parts of the land; they know the Kings perſon, his common courſes and actions, better than forraigners in other countries, and better than countrey people doe, that dwell farre off in the ſame kingdome, who doe not belong unto, nor follow the Court: but what is that to what a privie Counſellour knowes? The king ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them with ſpeciall ſecrets, with the myſteries of ſtate. They that are his Privie Counſellours, they know his mind, they are not onely of the Court, but of the Counſell alſo. Hypocrites and carnall perſons, that live in the Church, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miniſtery, they doe know many
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:233:92"/> truths that Heathens, and ſuch as live not under the meanes, know not; but yet they are but of the common ſort that follow the Court. It is the priviledge of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are ſet at the Counſell table, where the very ſecret myſteries of the kingdome are diſcloſed. It is ſomething which is ſpoken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 15. <hi>They ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kings Palace.</hi> It is ſomwhat to be Courtiers, to bee outwardly members of the Church; but yet this is not all the priviledge of the faithfull, there is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers:</hi> they come not onely into the King <hi>Palace,</hi> but into the Kings <hi>Chambers.</hi> The Kings chamber is the place of greateſt ſecreſie, 2 King. 6. 12. <hi>Eliſha the Prophet that is in Iſrael, telles the King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael the words thou ſpeakeſt in thy bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> The King hath brought mee into his <hi>Chambers:</hi> he hath revealed and imparted unto me the ſecrets of his heart, made them knowne to mee in his privie cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. So that the priviledge of the godly is, that they are not onely of the Court, but of the Counſell; they doe not onely know the <hi>Kings face,</hi> but the <hi>Kings heart,</hi> and the ſecrets in his breaſt. Nay, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:233:93"/> godly are not onely of the Court, and the Counſell, but they are the choyce and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar friends and favourites of God. It is ſayd of <hi>Zabud that he was principal officer, and the Kings friend,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 5. Hee was <hi>Solomons</hi> favourite; and a favourite is more than a Counſellour, and is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe ſecrets that every ordinary Counſellour knowes not, even with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet ſecrets. All Gods people are <hi>Zabuds,</hi> Gods friends and favourites; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God communicates his ſecrets to them. <hi>Abraham</hi> is here called Gods friend, and ſee how God ſpeakes of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I will doe?</hi> As if he had ſayd, <hi>Abraham is my friend,</hi> and therefore I may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale my minde from him.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:233:93"/> followes being the friends of Chriſt. When friends doe conceale ſecrets each from other, and communicate onely ſome trifling common things one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a ſigne of a crazed, and a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">

When once men have God for their friend, hee will not bee daintie of his ſecrets, but will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them unto them. And the more inward and entire the friendſhip is, the greater ſecrets he wil communicate unto
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:233:94"/> them. All his Diſciples were his friends, and therfore <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 15. he made known unto them <hi>all things he had heard of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But yet there was one Diſciple, which was <hi>the Diſciple whom Ieſus loved, Ioh</hi> 13. 23. and he <hi>leaned on Ieſus boſome.

So Chriſt dealt with <hi>Iohn,</hi> in diſcovering <hi>Iudas</hi> to be the traytour; he ſpake it not out, but ſecretly whiſpered that in his eare which he ſpeakes to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 26: The reſt of the Diſciples heard it not, as appears <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29, If Chriſt had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:233:95"/> ſpoken that in the hearing of all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that he ſpake to <hi>Iohn,</hi> they might eaſily have underſtood our Saviours meaning in his ſpeech to <hi>Iudas:</hi> And ſo ſtill doth God deale with the godly, which were his friends, hee ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales that in their eares, which <hi>neither eye hath ſeen, nor eare hath heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. Indeed men of the world, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not that a godly man hath any ſuch priviledge as to be acquainted with Gods ſecrets more than themſelves; they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a godly man by themſelves, and therefore ſay in this caſe, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake to <hi>Iob</hi> in that caſe, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15. 8, 9, 11. <hi>Haſt thou heard the ſecret of God? What knoweſt thou that we know not? What underſtandeſt thou that is not in us? Is there any ſecret thing with thee?</hi> But yet a godly man doth know that a worldly man knowes not; he doth underſtand ſomething that is not in him: there is ſome ſecret thing with him, and hee hath heard the ſecret of God, which hee hath not heard. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him, Pſalm.</hi> 25. And this is the firſt thing in which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:233:95"/> their communion with God ſtands, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his communication of his ſecrets unto them, being his friends.</p>

                     <hi>Conſultation.</hi> A man when he is in a pinch, or ſtreight, and knowes not well which way to winde, or turne himſelfe, whither goes hee for counſell, advice, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to his friends? And wherein doth or can a friend ſhew greater love, than in communicating unto him the beſt advice, and counſell that he can? No man conſults with ſtrangers, or enemies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe nor will ſuch give a man coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in his need, whats the beſt courſe to be taken? <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Oyntment and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume rejoyce the heart, ſo doth the ſweetneſſe of a mans friend by heartie counſell, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from the heart,</hi> from the ſoule. A friend hee gives heartie counſell, counſell from the heart, and that which comes from the heart, goes to the heart: and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a friend, his oyntment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume never ſmells ſo ſweet, as in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie counſells. See how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of him whom he had taken for his faithfull friend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 14. <hi>Wee tooke ſweet counſell together;</hi> not onely counſell, but <hi>ſweet</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:233:96"/> 
                     <hi>counſell.</hi> In thoſe ſweet counſels there was the ſweet oyntment, and ſweet perfume that rejoyced the heart. There is a great deale of ſweetneſſe in friendſhip by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of communion in this kinde. There was a wondrous entire friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan, The ſoule of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan was knit unto David, and Ionathan loved him as his owne ſoule,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 1. He was a true and a cloſe friend to him. And ſee wherein hee ſhewed himſelfe a friend unto him indeed; in nothing more than in his counſels. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 2, 3. and 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. through the whole chapter. When <hi>David</hi> was in danger and ſtreights, <hi>Ionathan</hi> gave him counſell and advice what to doe in thoſe ſtreights: therein he ſhewed himſelfe a friend, and did a true friends office unto <hi>David.</hi> And thus doth God ſhew himſelfe a friend to his people, and thus hee communicates himſelfe to them in the ſweet counſells he gives them. Hee gives them counſell from the heart; their pinches &amp; exigents are many times very ſore, they know not which way to winde, or turne themſelves. In ſuch ſtreights they goe to God, as to their friend, and they aske counſell of him, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:233:96"/> hee gives them counſell, and ſo adviſes and directs them, that their hearts are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a way ſhowne them how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves out of their difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>David</hi> was much diſquieted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his ſpirit about that caſe of the proſperitie of the wicked, and the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the godly, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 73. <hi>His feet were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone,</hi> his <hi>ſteppes had well-nigh ſlipt, verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>His heart was grieved, and he was prickt in his reines, verſ.</hi> 21. He goes into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, to aske counſell of God, and God did give him counſell, <hi>Thou holdeſt mee by my right hand, thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſell, verſ.</hi> 23, 24. God in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo counſeld him, that his heart was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. We finde <hi>David</hi> in a perplexitie of ſpirit upon an harder caſe than this, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 13. He was under a deſertion, God ſeemed to forget him, and to hide his face from him; and ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>How long ſhall I take counſell in my ſoule, having ſorrow in mine heart daily? David</hi> calles all his thoughts and wits to counſell in this ſtreight, ſets all the powers of his ſoule on worke, for the clearing of this queſtion, hee takes counſell in his ſoule long, and his heart is daily diſquieted, and full of heavineſſe:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:233:97"/> And yet in the end of the Pſalme we find his heart eaſed, and the caſe cleared to him. But how came it ſo? ſurely by that very way that is ſpecified, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>I will bleſſe the Lord, who hath given mee counſell, my reines alſo inſtruct mee in the night ſeaſons.</hi> Though Gods people at one time may ſay, <hi>How long ſhall I take counſell in my ſoule?</hi> yet they ſhall have cauſe to ſay at another time, <hi>I will bleſſe the Lord who hath given mee counſell.</hi> Though at one time they are <hi>pricked in their reines, Pſalm.</hi> 73. 21. yet at another time their <hi>reines ſhall inſtruct them.</hi> That's the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of Gods people, that howſoever they may have pinching exigents, and ſtreights, that may make them with <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,</hi> ſay, <hi>Lord, wee know not what to doe,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. yet they have a great, and a good friend in heaven, that failes them not, but as he is <hi>mightie</hi> in counſel, ſo he is <hi>ready</hi> in his counſels, and will counſell them what to doe in all their ſtreights. An hard caſe it is, when a mans ſpirit is in ſtreights, to bee friendleſſe, not to have a friend with whom a man may conſult, and into whoſe boſome hee may emptie and powre out his heart; but it is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:233:97"/> condition of the godly, that in their ſtreights they have him who is the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to be their friend, and <hi>counſellour, Iſai.</hi> 9.</p>

And thus doth God ſhew himſelfe a friend in this communion; though his dwelling bee in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:233:98"/> the <hi>higheſt heavens,</hi> yet he will come down to them, and dwell, and make his abode with them, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If any man love mee, hee will keepe my words, and my Father will love him, and wee will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> Such an abode as to take up our dwelling with him.

                  <p>Communion betweene friends ſtands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in <hi>Coambulation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Confabulation,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing, in walking and talking together. Friends take great delight in communion of this kinde, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 55. 24. <hi>We</hi> walked <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> wee had a great deale of chat and friendly talke together. <hi>Can two walke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether except they be agreed? Am.</hi> 3. and ſo can two bee agreed and knit together in the bonds of love and friendſhip, but they will walke together? It is that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and increaſes love, and friendſhip. And thus doth God vouchſafe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the godly being his friends. He will as a friend come walke and talke with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:233:98"/> them. Hee takes turnes with them in his walkes and galleries, Cant. 1. 17. <hi>Our galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are of firre,</hi> yea as one friend fallen in company with another is ſo tyed that hee knowes not how to part, and come away, ſo Cant. 7. 5. <hi>The king is held,</hi> tyed or bound <hi>in the galleries,</hi> as if the Lord were loath to leave thoſe walkes in his ordinances, in which he converſes with his people. Hee cals out his friends to take a walke with him, Cant. 7. 11. <hi>Come my beloved, let us goe forth into the fields, let us get up early into the vine yards, let us ſee if the vine flouriſh.</hi> Come let us walke out together into the fields, let us have a walke into the vineyards. And as they commune with the Lord in the ſecret of their ſoules, ſo God doth commune with them by his ſpirit, he hath his ſweet and ſecret conferences, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies with them: Gen. 17. 22. <hi>The Lord left off</hi> talking <hi>with Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 33. <hi>And the Lord went his way as ſoone as hee had left</hi> communing <hi>with Abraham.</hi> Exod. 31. 18. <hi>And he gave unto Moſes when he had made an end of</hi> communing with him, <hi>two Tables of Teſtimony.</hi> And ſee in what a familiar manner the Lord uſed to talke with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exo. 33. 11. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:233:99"/> 
                     <hi>face to face, as a man</hi> ſpeakes <hi>unto his friend.</hi> And though no man may come neere to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that ſpeciall priviledge of familiarity, yet in that meaſure and proportion the Lord vouchſafes unto all his Saints theſe familiar and friendly conferences in a ſpeciall manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> communion between friends ſtands in mutuall <hi>friendly viſitations.</hi> One friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> will viſit another, and where there is an entire friendſhip indeed, there will bee an entercourſe of frequent viſits each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Mary</hi> went to <hi>Elizabeth to viſit her at her houſe in the hill country.</hi> And ſo God hath his times when hee makes his <hi>viſits</hi> with his people. Ioh. 14. 23. <hi>Wee will come unto him,</hi> Pſal. 106. 4. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the favour thou beareſt unto thy people,</hi> O viſit me <hi>with thy ſalvation.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Lord remember me to be one of thy friends, and vouchſafe me ſome ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious friendly viſits, as thou uſeſt to afford to thy friends, and favourites. Hee ſhewes his friends hearts by his viſitations, ſheds his love into their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, gives them ſweet aſſurances of his favour, filles their hearts with peace, hee comes and brings them the hidden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:233:99"/> and the white ſtone, brings his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tokens with him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Communion betweene friends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſtands in <hi>mutuall feaſting, and banqueting</hi> each with other. Friends will invite each other, will call their friends to their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and will goe to their friends tables. Pſal. 41. 9. <hi>My familiar friend that eate of my bread.</hi> He therefore uſed to have his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend at his table, and to feaſt him with his good cheere. So God deales with his people, and holds communion with them of this kinde. Apoc. 3. 20. <hi>If any man will open unto mee, I will come in unto him, and I will ſuppe with him and hee with mee,</hi> Canticles 5. 2. <hi>Eate</hi> O Friends, <hi>and drinke abundantly O beloved.</hi> Looke what ſweete communion friends have together in mutuall feaſtings each of other, ſuch ſweet ſpirituall communion vouchſafes the Lord to his people.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is yet another expreſſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of that communion that is betweene friends. That which was betweene <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 41. <hi>And they kiſſed one another,</hi> and 2 Sam. 19. 39. <hi>David</hi> kiſſed <hi>Barzillai.</hi> So of ancient friends uſed to expreſſe their friendly love each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:233:100"/> And thus doth God expreſſe his communion with his people: as they <hi>kiſſe the Sonne.</hi> Pſal. 2. and Cant. 8. 1. <hi>When I ſhould finde thee without, I would kiſſe thee,</hi> ſo doth the Lord kiſſe them as his friends, Cant. 1. 1. <hi>Let him kiſſe mee with the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> Thats a great Honour and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. It is an honour, and a favour to kiſſe the kings hand, but when once wee are the friends of Chriſt, the friends of God, he gives us not his <hi>hand,</hi> but his <hi>lips,</hi> his <hi>mouth</hi> to kiſſe. And thus in thoſe things the godly have commnnion with God, and this communion they have by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his friends: and this is the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit wee have by having him our friend.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond benefit by having God their friend is, <hi>Boldneſſe</hi> and <hi>Familiarity of</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>Acceſſe</hi> to God in all our wants and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. When God is once our friend, wee may with an holy boldneſſe, and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity come into his preſence, and make knowne our wants unto him: when God is a mans enemy, or when God is but a ſtranger to a man, hee cannot bee ſo bold with him. It is the rule wee live by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. If a man bee our enemy,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:233:100"/> though wee ſtand in need of him, and hee might be beneficiall to us, yet we will not, wee cannot have the face to bee ſo bold and familiar with him, as to acquaint him with our neceſſities, becauſe being our enemy, wee conceive hee will but deſpiſe us, and bee glad of an occaſion that hee may looke darkely, and angrily upon us. Nay if a man bee but a ſtranger unto us, though there be no unkindneſſe, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betweene us, wee cannot indure to make bold with him. If wee bee put upon it, our plea is, Alas hee is a meere ſtranger to me, hee is one with whom I have very ſlender or no acquaintance at all, hee will wonder I ſhould make ſo bold with him. But now if a man have a ſpeciall friend with whom hee is inwardly well acquainted, if he want his helpe, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, his good word to ſpeake for him, hee can without any adoe make bold with him. <hi>A man</hi> we uſe to ſay, <hi>may be bold with his friends.</hi> And who ſhould a man make bold with but with his friends? The caſe is ſo here, whileſt God is our enemy, or a ſtranger unto us, we cannot have the face, or the heart to goe to him in our wants, and to make our caſes knowne unto him:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:233:101"/> we thinke that hee may well give us ſuch anſwer as <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave to <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the reſt that came with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 27. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come yee to mee, ſeeing ye hate me?</hi> what meane you to come to mee who am your enemy, who am at the eaſieſt a ſtranger to you, in whom you have no manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? <hi>Did yee not hate me,</hi> ſaies <hi>Iephthah</hi> to them. Iudges 11. 7. <hi>And why are yee come unto me, now when yee are in diſtreſſe?</hi> And ſuch anſwers our miſgiving hearts will tell us, we may expect, when wee are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God. But when once we are Gods friends, then wee may boldly goe to him, and make our minds knowne to him. Heb. 4. 16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that wee may obteine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in the time of neede.</hi> Gods people therefore may not onely goe, but goe boldly to the throne of Grace. But whence comes it that they may doe it? Even from hence, becauſe they are the Lords friends. It is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods friends that they may goe boldly into his preſence, Epheſ. 3. 12. <hi>In whom wee have boldneſſe, and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him.</hi> In Chriſt wee have this boldneſſe, becauſe in and by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:233:101"/> him, wee come to bee the friends of God. It is a bold part for a man to goe to his neighbour, at midnight, when he is in his bed, the doors ſhut to, and to diſturb, and raiſe him then out of his bed; <hi>Lu</hi> 11. 5. 8. but yet this excuſes all, hee is his friend to whom he goes, <hi>which of you ſhal have a friend &amp; ſhal go unto him at midnight,</hi> and ſhall ſay friend, lend mee three loaves? It is a bold part for a man in his Iourney to come at midnight to a friends houſe, and yet he to whom hee comes blames him not, but goes out at that time to make proviſion for him, and this makes him ſwallow all, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 6. <hi>For a friend of mine in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is come unto mee.</hi> It was the friendſhip that was betweene them that makes the traveller ſo bold, as to come at that time of night, and put him to ſuch trouble. Friends may make bold one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is the happineſſe of Gods people being his friends, that they make holily bold with God. Their comming to him is never troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>The third benefit by having God their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> friend is <hi>Aſſurance and certainety of ſpeede in all their lawfull and convenient ſuites, and prayers they make to God.</hi> To bee <hi>bold,</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:233:102"/> not to bee <hi>welcome</hi> is to little purpoſe, but to be <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>welcome</hi> both that is a great matter. Gods people cannot be ſo bold as welcome, as one friend uſes to ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It will not ſtand with Humanity, and with the lawes of friendſhip for a man to deny his friend any thing, a man knowes not how to ſay his friend nay; friends, whileſt they aske they command. And when a friend askes, his friends anſwers, you may command mee any thing. And therefore when God bids his people <hi>aske</hi> of him, he as one that ſpeakes in a friends language, to ſhew as the power and force of prayer, ſo alſo the force and power of friendſhip, bids them alſo <hi>command</hi> him, Iſa. 45. 11. <hi>Aske of mee, and concerning the worke of mine bands,</hi> command <hi>yee mee,</hi> for friends petitions are commands. God once being a mans friend, his petitions being rightly qualified, hee may be ſure God cannot ſay his friend, nay, but hee will doe for him what ever his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is. After <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſoule was knit to <hi>David,</hi> and that hee loved him as his owne ſoule, and had made him his choyce, and deere friend, ſee how hee ſpeakes to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>Whatſoever thy ſoule</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:233:102"/> 
                     <hi>deſires, I will doe it for thee,</hi> or, <hi>ſay what is thy minde,</hi> or what thy ſoule ſpeakes, or thinkes, <hi>and I will doe it for thee.</hi> And ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Barzillai,</hi> when hee had ſhowne himſelfe ſo true a friend unto him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 38. <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of mee, that will I doe for thee,</hi> ſuch a prevalent power hath a friend in his ſuites, and deſires to his friend, that as <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekias</hi> ſaid to the princes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 38. 5. <hi>The king can deny you nothing,</hi> ſo one friend can deny another nothing. <hi>Zabud</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 5. was the kings friend, how could then the king deny him any thing? It is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the kings friend to have the kings eare. The kings eare, and the kings hand, are both open to the kings friend, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. If <hi>Zabud</hi> be <hi>Salomons</hi> friend, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> can deny him nothing. If a friend aske, though he ſeeme to aske unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and unſeaſonable things, yet ſuch is the commanding power of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that a man is neceſſitated to gratifie him.</p>
                  <p>That ſame <hi>Lu.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>And I ſay unto you, ask, and it ſhall be given you, ſeeke, and ye ſhall find,</hi> &amp;c. is but an inference upon all that which is laid down in the foure former verſes, in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:233:103"/> which hee preſſes to prayer upon the ground of aſſurance to ſpeed. As if hee had ſaid, pray, and yee ſhall bee ſure to ſpeed. But why ſhall we be ſure? becauſe God is our friend. Amongſt men friends prevaile with their friends, and therefore God being your friend, you ſhall bee ſure alſo to prevaile with him. He takes his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from a compariſon of the leſſe to the greater, and there bee divers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments couched in thoſe words, to aſſure men of ſpeed in their prayers, they being Gods friends.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this. If ſo be that a man will not deny his friend asking a petition, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> making a requeſt unto him: then much leſſe will God deny his people, who are his friends. They are the Lords deere friends, therefore ſhall they bee ſure to ſpeede.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument is this. If a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> friend comming to his friend at an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, even <hi>at midnight.</hi> verſ. 5. when it muſt needs bee a trouble to him, when his children are at reſt, and the <hi>doore ſhut,</hi> verſ. 7. yet for all this prevailes with his friend, and ſpeeds in his ſuite. How much more then will God grant the ſuits
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:233:103"/> which his friends make to him, to whom no time is unſeaſonable. All times to God are ſeaſonable, hee is as ready at one time as at another. God is ready at all times and hours. His court of audience is alwaies open. His doores ſhut at no time. It is not with God as with men. To men a time of petitioning may bee unſeaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a time of his owne neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and refreſhment. A man may bee at his neceſſary repaſt, a man may bee in his bed, at his reſt and ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hee may want power at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſome time to doe that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hee may have buſineſſe, and occaſions of his owne, his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> imployments may neceſſarily wholly take him up.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hee may bee taken up with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> helping ſome other friend, he cannot doe for all at once. And therefore a man may come and deſire his friends helpe unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, but it is not ſo with God. All times are ſeaſonable with him. <hi>David</hi> will pray thrice a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. If <hi>David</hi> will be ſo oft at leaſure to pray, God will bee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:233:104"/> as oft at leaſure to heare. <hi>With my ſoule I have deſired thee in the night.</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. yea <hi>David</hi> will pray <hi>at midnight,</hi> Pſal. 119. 62. To come in the <hi>night,</hi> ſpecially <hi>at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night</hi> is unſeaſonable to man, not ſo to God. Morning, evening, noone, night, midnight, any time is a ſeaſonable time with God. Come when you will, Gods <hi>doore,</hi> and Gods <hi>eare</hi> is alwayes <hi>open.</hi> What aſſurance of ſpeed gives this to thoſe that be Gods friends? A man will helpe his friend at midnight, when hee is in bed, he will riſe to pleaſure him, though he come unſeaſonably, and will not God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more helpe his friends that can never come unſeaſonably to him? we may not imagine, that men can bee more kinde and friendly to their friends, then God is unto his.</p>
                  <p>The third argument is this. If a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will give unto him, or for his uſe, with whom he hath no familiarity, or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as here the friend in bed gives to his friend at the doore, three loaves, not for his owne uſe, but for his friends that is come unto him, a meere ſtranger to him: then how much more will God give unto his people, who are his friends, that which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:233:104"/> they aske for their owne neceſſity? The friend here in bed might have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his friend at the doore thus, if thou thy ſelfe, or any of thy children had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread, I would not have denyed to have given thee what thou askeſt, but in as much as thou askeſt for one that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, take it not ill that I doe not gratifie thee in this thing that thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. But yet wee ſee here is no ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Such is the power of friendſhip, that it bindes a man to doe for his friends friend, though a ſtranger to him. And if it binde a man to doe for his friends friend, how much more for a friend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? And if humane friendſhip be thus obligatory, that it will make a man doe for a ſtranger, for a friends ſake, then how much more is that divine love of God powerfull to make him doe for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they being his friends? God loves not his friends, leſſe then a man loves his.</p>
                  <p>The fourth argument is this. If a friend bee content to give thoſe loaves to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> friend, which yet hee cannot give unto him without diſquieting, and troubling of himſelfe and his, but though hee be in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:233:105"/> bed with his children, though the doore be ſhut, yet for all that he riſes, and gives him what he needs, though with ſo much trouble to him; if I ſay a friend will doe this for his friend, which hee cannot doe without ſo much trouble, then how much more will God grant the petitions of his people which are his friends, who can without any the leaſt trouble that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what they deſire of him? will a friend amongſt men, helpe his friend though it be to his owne trouble, and the trouble of his? then how can it ſtand with Gods love to his friends not to helpe them when hee can helpe them without any trouble at all? ſhall friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man be more prevalent then friendſhip betweene God and his friends? God is not troubled with ſleepe. <hi>He that keepes Iſrael neither ſlumbers, nor ſleepes,</hi> Pſal. 121. 4. And all that waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in heaven are waking, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſquieted, the gates and doores of heaven are never ſhut, it is no trouble at all therefore to God to helpe. Suppoſe it were a trouble to God to gratifie his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their prayers, yet why ſhould not hee doe as much for his friends, as one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:233:105"/> friend amongſt men will doe for another? A friend will helpe his friend though it be to his trouble; and therefore though it were with trouble to the Lord, why ſhould it bee thought that hee will not helpe his friends? And if hee would heare them, and helpe them, and doe for them that they aske, though it were to his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then how much more may they bee aſſured that hee will give them what they aske, when it is no trouble at all to him? If a man ſhould deſire his friend that hee might fetch water at his pond, and hee ſhould deny him, would not all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, that he ſhould refuſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him in that which might bee done with ſo little trouble to him? Now the Lord hee can doe the greateſt, and the hardeſt things wee aske with more eaſe then man can doe the eaſieſt: wee cannot with that eaſe ſay to a friend, take that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deus omnia creavit faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limo opere, Dicendo ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet, ut non plus nego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> deo ſit in creatione, quam nobis in appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one. Luther in Geneſ.</hi> 1.</note> thou askeſt, that God can give the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thing we aske. God without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all can give the greateſt thing wee aske. In the creation of the world <hi>God ſaid, let there be light, and there was light.</hi> He created the world by his word, <hi>Hee ſaid,</hi> To ſhew the eaſineſſe of the creation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:233:106"/> to him. It was no more to him to make the world, than it is to us to ſpeake a word. Nay, with more eaſe than we can ſpeake did God make the world; for we cannot ſpeake without the help of God, <hi>In him wee live, move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. But he is Independent, All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in, and of himſelfe, needing no help, or aſſiſtance from any other: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſier for him to make the world, than for us to ſpeake. And if God with ſuch eaſe created the world, then with how much eaſe can hee make good our petitions? Even juſt with the ſame eaſe, Luk. 7. 7. <hi>Onely ſay the word, and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi> What an eaſie thing is it for God to ſpeake a word? If therefore a friend will doe for his friend, though with his verie great trouble, diſeaſe, moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſquiet, then ſurely God being our friend will not deny us what we aske, in as much as he can do it with as little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the ſpeaking of a word. It is little he will doe for his friend, that will not ſo much as ſay a word for him. Certainely, God will both ſpeake and doe for his friends.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Argument is this. If a friend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:233:106"/> that at firſt refuſes his friend, and puts him off with excuſes, <hi>Trouble mee not, &amp;c.</hi> yet after is by his friend over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, how much more will God who invites us, calles upon us to ſeeke him, and promiſes to heare us when wee pray? ſhall a denying friend bee overcome, and ſhall not a promiſing God be prevailed withall? It were ſtrange if God, bound by his promiſe ſhould not be more prevailed withall by his friends, then a man that hath made no promiſe, but a flat denyall. And marke upon what ground the denying friend is prevailed withall verſ. 8 <hi>I ſay unto you, though he will not</hi> (that is, if he will not) <hi>riſe and give him becauſe he is his friend, yet &amp;c.</hi> That im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plies that our Saviour made account that that was a ſpeciall motive to worke upon him, becauſe he <hi>was his friend,</hi> and that that vvere enough to make him grant his deſire, it is troubleſome, it is unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. but yet I muſt yeeld, it is my friend that askes. In all vvhich paſſage vve ſee how many ſtrong reaſons our Saviour brings to aſſure us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God vvill grant our deſires, and they are grounded upon this, that vve are the friends of God. This
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:233:107"/> is therefore the great priviledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of being Gods friends that they ſhall be ſure to ſpeed with God when they ſeeke to him. Indeed many times in caſes of neceſſity a man ſhall finde but poore helpe from his friends, Prov. 19. 7. <hi>All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, how much more doe his friends goe farre from him? hee purſues them with words yet they are wanting unto him.</hi> But it is not ſo with God, he ownes and agnizes his friends in their neceſſities, he vvill not be wanting to his friends. Doe but ſee vvhat Chriſt hath done for his friends. Iohn 15. 13. <hi>greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friends.</hi> Did not Chriſt make dainty of his blood, of his life for his friends? and ſhall vve thinke that he will be ſtraight handed, or ſtreight hearted to them in ſmaller matters? That friend that vvill lay downe his life for his friends, will he deny his friends his purſe? vvill he deny them <hi>three loaves?</hi> no ſuch matter. They ſhall be vvelcome though they come at midnight. So happy a thing it is to have God for a friend. It is an happy thing vvhen a man hath a faithfull friend to whom he may breake his minde
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:233:107"/> when his heart is troubled. It is an eaſe to disburdon ones mind into the boſome of a friend, though he cannot helpe us, and give us remedy againſt our griefe. How much more then is it an happineſſe to have God for our friend, into whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome we may disburde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our minds in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he is ſuch a friend as will make good the prayers of his people, and helpe them in their needs. How many prayers doe many make to God, how many peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions put they up, and yet ſpeed not? How many begge three loaves, and yet get not one; and whats the reaſon? they have not God their friend, they are none of Gods friends, and therefore their ſpeed is ſuitable.</p>
                  <p>The fourth benefit the godly have by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> having God for their friend is <hi>defence and protection</hi> in all caſes of wrong, injury and oppreſſion, at leaſt <hi>pitty, and compaſſion,</hi> and a fellow-feeling with them in their troubles: yea ſuch a pitty and compaſſion as will ſtirre up God to ſtand to them, and by them in all their afflictions, ſo it is with friends amongſt men. If a man ſee his friend in miſery, and trouble, his heart earnes towards him, and his ſoule bleeds
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:233:108"/> within him, and all his thoughts and wits <note place="margin">Adverſas vero res ferre difficile eſſet ſine eo qui illas graviùs etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quam tu ferret. Cicer. in Lelio.</note> are vvorking to take a courſe for his help and reliefe. See how <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 21. <hi>Have pitty vpon me, have pity upon me, O ye my freinds.</hi> But vvhy ſhould he call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his friends to pitty him? ſee the reaſon. <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 14. <hi>To him that is afflicted pity ſhould bee ſhewed from his friend.</hi> It is a friends part, and duty to be compaſſionate to his friend in his extremity, and when friends doe not ſo, it is a ſigne that <hi>they forſake the feare of the Almighty,</hi> as there <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes. We ſee when <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends heard of all the evill that was come upon him, they come every one from his owne place, for they had made an appointment toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come <hi>to mourne with him, and to comfort him, Iob</hi> 2. 11. That was a friendly part, ſo ſhould friends doe, and ſo will friends doe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>There is a friend that ſtickes cloſer than a brother.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well might <hi>Iob</hi> complaine of it as a ſtrange caſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 19. <hi>All mine inward friends abhor me,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> 16. 20. <hi>my friends are my ſcorners.</hi> Your friend will not only have compaſſion but if it be in his power, he will ſtand to, and by his friend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his cauſe, and his right againſt all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:233:108"/> ſuch as would wrong and abuſe him. A mans blood riſes when hee heares or ſees his friend wronged, and many a man loſes his life in his friends quarrell. Marke how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>Abide thou with mee, feare not, hee that takes thy life ſhall take my life alſo,</hi> as ſome Tranſlations have it. And thus is it with the people of God being his friends: God will have compaſſion upon them in all their afflictions, his friendly heart will have a fellowfeeling with them in all their miſeries. <hi>Iſay</hi> 63. 10. <hi>Hee was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them,</hi> but before that hee vvas their friend, till by their ſinnes they made him their enemy. And vvhen he was their friend, then it was otherwiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>in all their affliction he was afflicted.</hi> God as a friend ſympathized with them in their ſorrowes, yea and hee will friendly ſtand to them, &amp; by them in all their vvrongs, he is a friend that ſticks cloſer then a brother. When <hi>Paul</hi> vvas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 11. <hi>The Lord</hi> ſtood by him and ſaid, <hi>feare not.</hi> The Lord as a friend came to him in priſon, as a friend encouraged him, and animated him therein, making good <hi>Salomons</hi> proverb,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:233:109"/> 
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 17. <hi>Iron ſharpens Iron, ſo a man ſharpens the countenance of his friend.</hi> When a man is dejected, diſconſolate and ſad of countenance, if his friend come to him, and comfort and cheere him with words of conſolation, it refreſhes his ſpirit, and puts ſuch life into him as makes his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance lightſome. Thus the Lord as a good friend comes to <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon, and cheares his ſpirit, and ſharpens his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. It was no friendly part of thoſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>At my firſt anſwere no man ſtood</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Paravit animum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culalaturum opem. Cum primum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puerit cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, diſcedet. Senec. ep.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>with me, but all men forſooke me.</hi> Thoſe that profeſt themſelves <hi>Pauls</hi> great friends durſt not owne him when he was conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before <hi>Nero,</hi> there his friends failed him, but yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>The Lord</hi> ſtood <hi>with me and ſtrengthned me,</hi> God ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a faithfull friend to <hi>Paul,</hi> hee did goe to the barre with <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſtood with him there, and ſtrengthened him there. And to this purpoſe is that worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that when our Saviour was to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and encourage his Diſciples againſt the feare of perſecutions he calls them by the name of <hi>friends, Luke</hi> 12. 4. <hi>And I ſay unto you,</hi> my friends, <hi>bee not afraid of them that kill the body, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:233:109"/> ſaid, you ſhall meete with a great deale of hard meaſure in the world, you ſhall be perſecuted to the very death, but yet be not afraid of theſe perſecutors. And why not afrayd? I ſay unto you <hi>my friends,</hi> be not afraid. You are my friends, and therefore I will not be wanting unto you, I will ſtand by you, either to deliver you, or to ſtrengthen you, and at laſt to right you in all your wrongs. And ſo when the Lord would comfort and encourage his people againſt the feare of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and their wrongs, and when hee would terrifie the enemies of his Church, he doth both upon this very ground, that he is his peoples friend, and they his. See <hi>Iſai</hi> 41. 10, 11, 12, 13. what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto his people not to feare, and what terrour to their enemies, and ſee upon what ground, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>But thou Iſrael art my ſervant, Iacob whom I have choſen, the ſeed of Abraham my friend.</hi> And therefore feare not, you are the ſeed of my friend, and therefore I will helpe you, aſſiſt you and protect you, and take your part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your enemies, and will be ſeverely revenged upon all ſuch as oppoſe you, and oppreſſe you. Such an advantage
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:233:110"/> there is in being the ſeed of Gods friend. And therefore <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> when hee was in feare and danger pleads with God by this very argument, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Thou gaveſt this land to the ſeed of Abraham thy friend for ever.</hi> Thou gaveſt this land to thy friend, and to his heires: now therefore Lord maintaine the cauſe of thy friend, and the title of thy friend. If a man ſee his friend wronged, and others offering injuriouſly to thruſt him out of his poſſeſſion, and inheritance, it concernes a friend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his friends right to the utmoſt, therefore ſaies <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> Lord ſtand for thy friend, take thy friends part, and maintaine thy friends right. If a man ſee his friend wronged and others offering to thruſt him out of his poſſeſſion and inheritance, it concernes a friend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the right of his friend, and his heires to the utmoſt, therefore Lord ſtand to thy friend, and maintaine the poſſeſſion thou gaveſt to thy friend. And ſurely herein the Lord failes not, but hee ſtands cloſe to his friends. Indeed men doe not alwaies ſtand cloſe to their friends, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 12. <hi>My lovers and my friends</hi> ſtand aloofe <hi>from my ſore, and my kinſmen ſtand afarre of.</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:233:110"/> The Samaritans when it went well with the Jewes, would claime kindred of them, and profeſſe great friendſhip to them, but when things went croſſe with them, and they were in ſtreights, then they would have nothing to doe with them. But it is not ſo with the Lord, hee is not ſuch a friend. <hi>The rich hath many friends. Prov.</hi> 14, 10. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>All the brethren of the poore doe hate him, how much more doe his friends goe farre from him? hee purſues them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</hi> That is indeed the common courſe of the world, but the Lord hee is like that true friend, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>A friend loves at all times,</hi> yea God loves at no time more then when his people are moſt friendleſſe. <hi>And I ſay unto you my friends, feare not, Luke</hi> 12. 4. why doth hee call them friends then more then at other times, why friends now he ſpeaks of perſecution? Certainely to ſhew that hee will never bee a greater friend, and that hee will never ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more a friend unto them then when men ſhall ſhew moſt malice and enmity againſt them. He ſhewes greateſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip when men ſhew greateſt enmity; Chriſt will ſtand by his friends in their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:233:111"/> greateſt pleaſures. The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> was the beloved Diſciple, whom Chriſt made his ſpeciall friend. And <hi>John</hi> carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him as a faithfull friend againe, when Chriſt vvas in the high Prieſts hall <hi>Iohn</hi> was with him there, and when Chriſt hung upon the Croſſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtood by him there, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 26, <hi>the Diſciple ſtanding by whom Ieſus loved.</hi> He ſhewed himſelfe a friend to Chriſt, that would not forſake him then, but would bee with him, and ſtand by him to the laſt. Juſt ſuch a friend doth Chriſt ſhew himſelfe to his people, he will not forſake them in their troubles and leave them in their extremities, but he will ſtand by them to the laſt, hee will ſtand by them at the barre, hee will ſtand by them even on their croſſes, when they hang there, hee will ſtand by them when they ſtand at the ſtake. The Martyrs found this true, they ever found God moſt friendly when their enemies uſed them moſt curriſhly: what made them ſo cheerefull and comfortable in their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude when kept from all company? God their friend hee viſited them and kept them company in their priſons, hee did with them as with <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 39. 20, 21.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:233:111"/> 
                     <hi>Ioſephs maſter took him &amp; put him in priſon, and hee was there in priſon, but the Lord was with Ioſeph, and ſhewed him mercy.</hi> God was with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> in the priſon with <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> what a true friend was <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> to <hi>Paul, that he ſought out Paul,</hi> and came to him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>and oft refreſhed him.</hi> It was a true and kinde friends part indeed that hee did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16, 17. So kinde a friend is God to his ſervants, he finds them out in their priſons, comes to them, viſits them oft, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes them oft. Their priſons were naſty ſtinking places, how was it that they were able to abide them? See the reaſon <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Oyntment and perfume rejoyce the heart, ſo doth the ſweetneſſe of a friend.</hi> The ſweetneſſe of this friend that viſited them kept them company, and refreſhed them in their priſons and dungeons, made their priſons and dungeons ſweet, made them Paradiſes and <hi>delectable hortyardes,</hi> as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mo.</note> that Italian Martyr calles the <hi>leonine priſon</hi> from whence hee wrote that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable letter of his. The ſweetneſſe of ſuch a friend perfumes priſons and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and overcomes the naſtineſſe and noyſomneſſe of them. If God bee with us who can be againſt us? if God bee our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:233:112"/> friend who ſhall be our foe? or what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it who bee our foe? this is one of the benefits and great priviledges wee have by being the friends of God.</p>
                  <p>The fift benefit the godly have by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God their friend is <hi>friendſhip with,</hi> and ſervice of all the creatures. Whiles wee are Gods enemies wee have all the creatures for our enemies: the Angels are our enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 5, 6. <hi>Let the Angell of the Lord chaſe them, let the Angell of the Lord perſecute them.</hi> Men, even ſuch as in nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt bonds to us are bitter enemies to us. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Living in malice and envy, hatefull, and hating one another.</hi> Our owne hearts and conſciences are at enmity with us, never quiet, but ever pinching and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, nothing but clamouring and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt us. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, Iſai.</hi> 57. 21. yea the beaſts of the field are enemies to us, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 22. <hi>If you walke contrary unto mee, I will ſend wild beaſts amongſt you which ſhall rob you of your children.</hi> If you bee enemies to mee, I will make the beaſts enemies to you. But when once wee are friends vvith God, and hee is become our friend, then all his ſervants become both friends and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:233:112"/> ſervants unto us. The Angels become our friends, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>The Angell of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and delivereth them.</hi> A mans enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his friends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 7. <hi>When a mans waies pleaſe the Lord, hee maketh even his enemies,</hi> his deadly profeſt enemies, <hi>to bee at peace with him.</hi> The reſt of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures become his friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 8. <hi>I would ſeeke unto God,</hi> I would ſeeke to be friends with him, but what ſhall be gotten by it? Amongſt other things, that <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22, 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt be hid from the ſcourge of the tongue, neither ſhalt thou bee afraid of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction when it comes: at deſtruction and famine ſhalt thou laugh, neither ſhalt thou bee afraid of the beaſts of the earth, for thou ſhalt be</hi> in league <hi>with the ſtones of the field, and the beaſts of the field ſhall bee</hi> at peace <hi>with thee.</hi> Yea God will make a <hi>covenant for his people with the beaſts of the fields, and with the fowles of Heaven, and with the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things of the ground, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 18. Yea all theſe ſhall not onely lay aſide their enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſhall be ready to bee ſerviceable to them. When <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> had made a league of friendſhip each with other, ſee how <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſpeakes to him,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:233:113"/> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horſes as thy horſes.</hi> So when once God, and we are in league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hee will ſay unto us, my ſervants are your ſervants, mine Angels are your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, mine hoſts are your hoſts, my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are your creatures, <hi>Al things are yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. And <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God,</hi> and are his friends. If a man be a traytor &amp; the Kings enemy, every man not onely eſtranges, but ſets himſelfe againſt him? but let the King but pitch upon a man to make him his friend and favourite, how then doth every one ſeek to him &amp; ſmile upon him, &amp; happy is he that can ingratiate himſelf with him, and doe any ſervice to him that is the Kings favourite. A man that is once the Kings friend ſhall be ſure to want no friends, no reſpect, no ſervice, <hi>Zabud was the Kings friend,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 5. and who then would not be a friend to <hi>Zabud,</hi> full glad was hee that could bee <hi>Zabuds</hi> ſervant. So if once we be Gods friends, God will raiſe us up friends enow. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his argument was good, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelfe now with him, and be at peace.</hi> Get to be Gods friend, and one of his inward acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:233:113"/> Well, ſuppoſe we doe, vvhat ſhall we get by it? <hi>And thereby ſhall good come unto thee.</hi> And this good amongſt the reſt that the creatures ſhall bee in a league of friendſhip with thee. Indeed ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there are that the more we are Gods friends, the more they will bee our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yea therfore our profeſſed enemies, becauſe wee are Gods friends, Satan and his ſworne ſervants will bee the more bitter enemies againſt us becauſe God ownes us for his friends, as <hi>Eſau</hi> hated <hi>Iacob for the bleſſing.</hi> But yet the Angels in Heaven that rejoyce at the converſion of a ſinner on earth, and that hee becomes friends vvith God, all good men, and the creatures will be our faithfull friends, yea and many times hee vvill make vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men doe his people many a friendly turne, or at leaſt vvill make their emnity beneficiall, and advantagious to them. And theſe be the benefits that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have by having God their friend. Come vve now to the uſes of this point. And they are theſe.</p>
                  <p>The honour and happineſſe of being <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Gods friends being ſo great and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall withall, it ſhould ſtirre up every man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:233:114"/> to get this happineſſe of being the friends of God. <hi>Zabud was the Kings friend,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 5. Now when people ſaw how famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar <hi>Zabud</hi> was with the King, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was betweene him and <hi>Salomon,</hi> how hee communicated to him his ſecret counſels, how potent he was with him in all ſuites, how cloſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſtood to him upon all occaſions, how ſerviceable all the Courtiers and Subjects were to him, did they not, thinke wee, all thinke his condition happy? Did they not ſecretly wiſh, Oh that I were in his caſe, oh that I were as <hi>Zabud</hi> is, that I had the Kings heart, the Kings eare, the Kings hand as he hath? And if they had knowne of any project, of any courſe by which they might have advanced themſelves to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buds</hi> condition, would they not ſpeedily have ſet upon it? would they not have ſtrained and tentred their wits to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt? would they have ſpared for any coſt, or paines, to have gotten into <hi>Zabuds</hi> condition? Wee now therefore ſeeing what the happy condition of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, that they are Gods friends, and have all thoſe great priviledges thereby, how ſhould it ſtirre up our hearts to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:233:114"/> looke, and labour for this happineſſe of being Gods friend. And that ſo much the rather,</p>
                  <p>Becauſe God may have, and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends at once, that are his inward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> familiars: not ſo alwayes amongſt men. Affection is ſometimes ſo pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome one, that that one engroſſes all a mans affections; and they are ſo caried wholly upon ſome one, that there is ſcarce any roome in the heart left for any other. The whole ſtreame of ſome mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is ſo carried in one channell, that there is no over float to any other. All their water is little enough to drive one mill. Kings uſe not to have many favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but pitch upon ſome one. But now it is otherwiſe with God, hee hath many friends and favourites, and all his friends are favourites; Gods heart and his love is ſo large, that there is roome enough in it for a multitude of favourites at once.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe there bee projects and courſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to be uſed, that will effect, and compaſſe this for us, to make us Gods friends. Some policies men have, and uſe, to get the friendſhip and favour of Princes, &amp; great ones; but yet their projects alwayes take
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:233:115"/> not, their policies ſpeed not, they doe not compaſſe the thing they deſire, but for the getting of Gods favour, and friendſhip, there be waies to be uſed that will ſurely doe the deed, and will worke us in to be Gods friends, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites.</p>
                  <p>What then bee thoſe waies by which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> we may get this honour to have God our friend, and to be his friends?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the way to get in with God is by <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> faith. We are by nature ſtrangers to God, nay enemies, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. Now God of his infinite mercy though hee bee the party wronged, and offended, yet he is pleaſed thus much to forget himſelfe, and to ſtoope thus low, as not onely to offer us peace and friendſhip, but hee entreates and <hi>beſeeches us to bee reconciled,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come friends, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Now then if wee will believe the Goſpell, and the words of Reconciliation, thats the chiefe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God requires, and upon that he will take, and owne us for his friends. Thats here in the text, <hi>Abraham was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the friend of God;</hi> a great honour, but how came <hi>Abraham</hi> by it? <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>believed God, and he was called</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:233:115"/> 
                     <hi>the friend of God.</hi> So that by faith <hi>Abraham</hi> became Gods friend. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>The father himſelfe loveth you,</hi> God is your friend, and takes you for his friends, and why ſo? <hi>Becauſe ye have believed that I came out from God.</hi> Chriſt hath made an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a reconciliation by his blood, faith lays hold on that reconciling blood, and ſo God and we become friends. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>You that were enemies hath he now reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death. If ye continue in the faith.</hi> Hee that will get in with God muſt doe theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He <hi>muſt get in with Gods favorite.</hi> That is the way to get the Kings friendſhip, yea any ordinary mans friendſhip. If a man honour and regard the favourite, and get in with him, and bee gracious with him, and he will procure a man the Kings favour, hee will bring him in with the King: it is not poſſible to have the Kings favour and bee out and at oddes with the favourite. So here, If we would get in with God, and be his friends then get in with his favourite. The Lord Ieſus Chriſt is Gods favourite, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 7. Hee is called Gods <hi>fellow-friend. Awake O ſword</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:233:116"/> 
                     <hi>againſt my ſhepheard, and againſt the man that is my fellow,</hi> or my <hi>fellow-friend,</hi> as the word may be tranſlated: the Diſciple whom Chriſt <hi>loved lay in his boſome, Iohn</hi> 13, And Chriſt is in the <hi>boſome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. He is his boſome-friend and favourite, and as to his boſome-friend communicates all his boſome ſecrets to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 20. <hi>For the Father loves the Sonne, and ſhewes him all things that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth.</hi> Now then get but in with Chriſt, and be gracious with him, and then wee ſhall bee ſure to bee friends of God, he will preſently ſmile upon us and accept of us for his deere friends. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gods people after they are made friends, doe that which may make God fall out with them, and frowne upon them. Now when it is ſo, it is Chriſt that makes us whole againe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ieſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> and hee it is that by his Advocation mediates our cauſe with God, and ſets us in joynt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and makes all well againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us. And as it is hee that doth repaire and heale all breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us after wee be friends,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:233:116"/> ſo it is that muſt firſt bring us into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and favour with God. Chriſt is Gods <hi>fellow-friend,</hi> and Chriſt and his people are <hi>fellow-friends, Cant.</hi> 5. 16. The Church calles Chriſt her fellow-friend, <hi>This is my beloved, and this is my friend,</hi> or <hi>my fellow-friend,</hi> as ſome tranſlate it. And <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 10. Chriſt calles his Church his fellow-friend, <hi>Riſe up my love, or my fellow-friend,</hi> as ſome read it. It comes from a word that ſignifies to feed, and ſo ſignifies ſuch friends as feed together at one &amp; the ſame table, that live fellowly, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly together. Now then the onely way to become Gods friend is to become a <hi>fellow-friend with Gods fellow-friend,</hi> be a fellow-friend with Chriſt who is Gods fellow-friend: and that is done by faith, by believing wee become his friends, and ſo the friends of God falling in with his favorite by faith.</p>
                  <p>He that would bee Gods friend, muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> have a <hi>care to pleaſe God.</hi> Amongſt men they that will ſeek friendſhip with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, muſt bee carefull to pleaſe thoſe whoſe friendſhip they ſeeke. Hee that is ambitious of the friendſhip of his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, muſt endevour to pleaſe them; where
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:233:117"/> there is no obſervance nor care to pleaſe, there friendſhip will never cloſe. It is ſo in this caſe, we cannot be Gods friends, till we lay to pleaſe him; If once we can but pleaſe him, he will be graciouſly pleaſed to be our friend: pleaſe him, and hee will make our enemies our friends; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himſelfe will be our friend much more. Now faith is the way to pleaſe him. <hi>Enoch</hi> had this teſtimony, that hee pleaſed God; <hi>but without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11. 5, 6. Faith then is that which pleaſes him, and pleaſes him ſo much, that upon it hee will be friends with us.</p>
                  <p>He that will bee Gods friend, muſt bee <hi>a childe of Abraham. Abraham</hi> was called <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the friend of God, and hee that will bee Gods friend, muſt be a ſonne of <hi>Abraham. I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> and ſo, I will bee thy friend, and the friend of thy ſeed. They muſt be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed that will bee in the number of Gods friends. How come we to bee the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> That we ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>There is a ſeed which is of the faith of Abraham, which is the father of us all.</hi> When wee have the faith that was in our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:233:117"/> when we <hi>walke in the ſteppes of that faith of our Father Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 12. then we are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> look what makes us the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that makes us as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> the friends of God: and ſo faith making us <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, makes us Gods friends. We muſt be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, the children of Gods friends, before wee can be the friends of God. Now faith is that by which we come to be the children of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the ſame are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham.</hi> This day is ſalvation come to this houſe, <hi>for ſo much as hee alſo is the ſonne of Abraham,</hi> ſayd our Saviour of <hi>Zacheus:</hi> ſo ſoone as he beleeved, he was a ſonne of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo ſoone as a ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a friend of God.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Repentance:</hi> ſinne is that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all enmitie between God and us: that's the make-bate between God &amp; man. The falling out with ſinne makes way for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in with God, and upon repentance God will manifeſt himſelfe a friend unto us. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. Yet returne againe to mee, ſayth the Lord, as if he had ſayd, Doe but repent, and we will be friends, and all ſhal be well againe. When two friends are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:233:118"/> fallen out, three things muſt bee done to make them friends againe. 1. Firſt, there muſt be a meeting: for if they keep aſunder, and one decline another, and will not come each at other, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be friends: but if they will be friends, they muſt meet. So when God and wee are out, unleſſe he and wee meet, we ſhall never bee friends. Now repentance that makes a mans ſtout and proud heart come down, makes him come out to meet God, <hi>Am.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> Then there is a poſſibilitie of friendſhip and reconciliation, if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance wee goe out to meet the Lord. And when we goe out to meet God, God will come forth to meet us; and hee will meet us, as <hi>Eſau</hi> met <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33. 3. 4. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob bowed himſelfe to the ground ſeven times, untill hee came neere to his brother, and Eſau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his necke, and kiſſed him,</hi> and ſo became friends with him. So when we come out to meet God, and bow, and humble our ſoules before him, hee will run to us, and embrace us, and kiſſe us in token of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie friendſhip, and reconciliation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 20. <hi>When he was a great way off,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:233:118"/> towards him, <hi>his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ranne, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him.</hi> 2. Secondly, there muſt be an acknowledgement on the offenders part, of his errour, that hee hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that he is ſorry, and grieved, and that if it were to doe againe, hee would not doe it. Though a man have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother wrong, and have made a friend an enemy; yet upon his ſubmiſſion, and fault acknowledged, all is healed, and the breach made up againe: yea, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours commandement is in ſuch caſes, that there ſhould be an heartie redintegration of love and friendſhip. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 3. 4. <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him. And if hee treſpaſſe againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turne againe to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive,</hi> &amp; be good friends with him. Thus is it much more with God, though wee have ſinned and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many a time againſt him, yet if wee come with ſubmiſſion, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gods friendly and fatherly heart will come off. If thou have ſinned againſt God, and treſpaſſed againſt him many, &amp; many a time, yet if thou turn to him again
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:233:119"/> and ſay, I repent, hee will aſſuredly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee, and will bee good friends with thee. We may not imagine, that God wil in this caſe require more of us than hee will do himſelfe: If he require thus much of us, whoſe mercies are but drops to his Ocean, what will hee doe, who is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bowels, <hi>that hath multitude of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, Iſai.</hi> 63. 15. and <hi>the God that multiplies to pardon, Iſai.</hi> 55. 7. God is quickly friends with an humbled ſoule, if hee ſees a man droope, and mourn for having offended, he is very inclinable to entertaine termes of friendſhip with ſuch an one. 3. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there muſt bee a cloſing with ſuch an one againſt his common enemies, and an hating and oppoſing of them. This very thing cloſes mens hearts many times in a ſtrong league, and bond of friendſhip. So here, if wee would bee Gods friends, wee muſt fall out with our ſelves, with our luſts, and maintaine an oppoſition and an hatred, even a deadly feud againſt them. Now this repentance teaches a man to doe. True repentance makes a man to fall out bitterly with himſelfe, filles him with a mortall vindictive hatred againſt his luſts and corruptions. And when the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:233:119"/> Lord ſees that, he then reſolves that ſuch an one whom he ſees ſo cordial an enemy to his enemies ſhall become his friend. And thus by Repentance are we made the friends of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by <hi>obedience to God, and his</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Commandements.</hi> It is true that it is faith that firſt makes God and men friends, but after faith hath knit that band of amity betweene God and us, that friendſhip is encreaſed and more and more confirmed by yeelding God obedience, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelfe now with him, and be at peace,</hi> ſeeke to bee friends with God, and get inward acquaintance with him, not onely get peace, but labour to grow ſuch friends with him that thou mayeſt be of his familiar acquaintance. Thats the thing, thou wilt ſay, that thou wouldeſt faine doe, but thou wouldeſt know how that may bee done. Marke therefore what followes in the next words, <hi>Receive I pray thee the Law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</hi> If thou wouldeſt bee acquainted with God bee acquainted with his word, lay that up in thine heart, and yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that in thy life. And ſo Chriſt

That as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Hee that loveth pureneſſe of heart, for the grace of his lips the King ſhall bee his friend.</hi> So much here, hee that loves pureneſſe of heart, and pureneſſe of life, that is pure as God is pure, for that holineſſe, and purity the King of Heaven ſhall bee his

                  <p>Fourthly, by our love to God. Amongſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> men love winnes, gaines, and kindles love. As a man that <hi>hath friends muſt ſhew himſelfe friendly. Prov.</hi> 18. 24. So a man that <note place="margin">

Hee loves us and is our friend: now if wee ſhew a friends love to him, hee will adde further degrees of his love, or hee will love, that is hee will vouchſafe us further expreſſions of his love, as Chriſt there explaines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelfe</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:233:121"/> 
                     <hi>to him.</hi> So that upon our friendly love to Chriſt, though hee loves us before wee love him, yet hee will more cleerely manifeſt and expreſſe his friendſhip to us.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, by a frequent uſe of the duty of prayer. A man that deſires another mans friendſhip muſt bee often in his company, muſt have converſe with him, and frequent conference with him. It was a neere bond of love and friendſhip that was betweene <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>The ſoule of Ionathan was knit with the ſoule of David, and Ionathan loved him as his owne ſoule.</hi> But how and upon what grew this friendſhip, how came <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſo to affect <hi>David?</hi> ſee the beginning of the verſe, <hi>And it came to paſſe that as David had made an end of ſpeaking unto Saul.</hi> Hee was in <hi>Davids</hi> company, he heares him ſpeake and ſees a ſweet ſpirit in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee is wonderfully taken with him. If <hi>David</hi> had not beene in <hi>Ionathans</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and company: if <hi>Ionathan</hi> had not ſeene him and heard him ſpeake, hee had never been ſo taken with him as to make him his choyce, and deare friend: but now when hee is in <hi>Ionathans</hi> company,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:233:121"/> and there ſpeakes in his audience, it came to paſſe <hi>that as hee had made an end of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that the ſoule of Ionathan was knit unto the ſoule of David.</hi> In that converſe that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> had with <hi>David</hi> was his heart knit to him. It is ſo here, in prayer a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God, hath conferences, and ſoliloquies with him, and ſo by the often frequenting of Gods company, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him he growes into acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him. See how Chriſt ſpeakes to his Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Let mee ſee thy countenance, let me heare thy voyce, for ſweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance comely.</hi> A praying countenance is <hi>comely</hi> in Chriſts eye, and a praying voyce is <hi>ſweet</hi> in his eare. And as he deſires to ſee that counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Let mee ſee thy countenance,</hi> and as hee deſires to heare that voyce, <hi>Let mee heare thy voyce,</hi> ſo when he doth heare that ſweet voyce and ſee that comely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, hee is wonderfully taken with it, falles exceedingly in love with it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed mine heart my ſiſter, my Spouſe; thou haſt raviſhed mine heart with one of thine eyes.</hi> Thou haſt <hi>wounded mine heart,</hi> or thou haſt <hi>taken my heart out of me,</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:233:122"/> haſt unhearted me, as a friends heart lives <note place="margin">

If one eye did it, what would both have done? All ſerves to ſhew how Chriſts heart is wonne in prayer, that looke as ſoone as <hi>David</hi> had made an <hi>end of ſpeaking, Ionathans</hi> heart went out of himſelfe, and his ſoule was knit with the ſoule of <hi>David,</hi> ſo after a faithfull ſoule hath <hi>done ſpeaking</hi> in prayer, Chriſts ſoule is knit to his ſoule, and ſuch converſe makes Chriſt love a man as his owne ſoule. Nothing more knits and rivets the heart of Chriſt and a Chriſtian together in a league of ſweet acquaintance then converſing with him in the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. In this duty God and his people take acquaintance one of another, and grow into a familiarity each with other. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>I will ſay it is my people, and they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God.</hi> I will take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, and they ſhall take acquaintance with mee, I will owne them, and they ſhall owne me, and there ſhall be a mutuall ſtipulation of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and familiarity betweene us. Well,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:233:122"/> but when ſhall this be done? marke the words immediately going before, <hi>They ſhall call upon my Name, and I will ſay</hi> &amp;c. This entercourſe of kindneſſe, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity ſhall bee in and upon the duety of prayer. In and upon that ſhall there bee theſe mutuall friendly paſſages, and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning each of other. Yea if at any time we doe that which may cauſe God to fall out with us, and to looke ſtrange upon us, yet prayer is a ſpeciall meanes to worke us in with God againe, and a godly man prayes himſelfe friends with God. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hee adviſes married couples to love each other, and to live together in conjugall friendſhip, <hi>that their prayers may not bee interrupted,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. And ſo a man may wiſh them to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that their <hi>loves bee not interrupted.</hi> As love will keepe prayers from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſo prayers will keepe love from interruption. As it is true, keepe friends that you may pray, love that you may pray; ſo it is true, pray that you may keepe friends, pray that you may love. Prayer is that which will keepe them friends. But ſometimes it may be, there may be ſome breach betweene man and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:233:123"/> wife. It is poſſible there may be ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of their love, there may bee a rupture in conjugall friendſhip. What is to be done then? let both goe together to God in prayer, and hee will ſet all in joynt, and ſend them from him better friends then ever. Prayer will make up ſuch rupture againe. So is it in this caſe: Prayer will prevent an interruption of our friendſhip with God; or if we do that which may cauſe a rupture, yet if we doe but goe to the Lord in prayer, and ſeeke earneſtly to him in that duty, hee will at laſt bee friends with us againe, and ſend us better friends from him then before. Prayer will pervert, and will heale rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this bleſſed friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Thus now wee ſee how we may come to get this honour and happineſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods friends, and therefore now let us ſeriouſly ſet upon this courſe, and make triall of theſe concluſions. <hi>I pray thee,</hi> ſaies <hi>Eliphaz, acquaint thy ſelfe with him, and be at peace with him, thereby ſhall good come to thee, Iob</hi> 22. 21. All this good of communing with God, of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with him, of ſpeeding in the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of defence and aſſiſtance in time
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:233:123"/> of troubles, of peace and friendſhip with the creatures, all this good ſhall come to thee upon friendſhip with God. So much good, how ambitious ſhould it make us of this honour of being Gods friends? How many waſte their very eſtates out of a deſire to have the friendſhip and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the great ones of the earth, and yet hardly get, or more hardly keepe it when they have done? Many a man is undone with the friendſhip of great ones, and looſe by it, and many times bring their houſes to ruine by it, but this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is for <hi>good,</hi> there is gaine by it, never did or ſhall any man looſe by it, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God for his friend. There be three times in ſpeciall that a man ſhall finde it to ſtand him in ſtead to have God for his friend, and to be in the number of his friends:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, at the <hi>Time of the Sacrament:</hi> when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a man comes to the Sacrament, to the Lords Table, it is good then being Gods friend. Whoſoever comes to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath not firſt made himſelfe Gods friend, is like to meete with a very cold welcome. When a man comes to the Sacrament, he comes to the Lords Table,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:233:124"/> God will bid none welcome to his Table but his very friends. The Sacrament is a feaſt, and it is a feaſt that God makes only for his friends, and if a man thruſt in that is none of his friends, his welcome is like to be thereafter. If a man make a feaſt, it is for his friends; no man will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, much leſſe welcome his enemies to his table. If a mans enemy ſhould bee ſo impudent as to thruſt in at a feaſt to his table, a man could not but lowre upon him, and give him ſowre lookes, if not ſowre words; a man would be ſtarke ſicke of him to ſee him at his table. And doe wee thinke that God will ſmile upon, and cheere up his enemies at his Table? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed amongſt men, if a ſtranger comes to a mans table that hath relation to ſome friend from whom, or with whom hee comes, we will in civility give him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainement; but if hee bee a meere ſtranger that comes wee know not whence, and goes we know not whither, we will not be forward to entertaine ſuch an one: but if an enemy, we cannot brook his preſence, nor the ſight of him. And though wee will welcome ſtrangers for our friends ſake, yet ſo will not God:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:233:124"/> every man muſt come to Gods Table by vertue of his owne intereſt in God. If a man come a ſtranger to the Lords Table, God will looke upon him as a ſtranger, and if a man come as an enemy, God will looke as an enemy upon him. Who would goe to another mans table if the good man will not welcome him, and bid him eate and fall to? and what ſhould a man doe at the Lords Table, if God will not bid him welcome, and cheare him up, and bid him eate? But now at ſuch a time when a man goes to the Lords table, it is good being Gods friend. Gods friends ſhall be ſure to be bid hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome, and they ſhall bee ſure to finde friendly welcome indeed. <hi>Take, eate,</hi> ſaies Chriſt: I but who be they that bee called upon to eate? That we ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Eate, O friends, and drinke, yea drinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, O beloved.</hi> There was one <hi>Math.</hi> 22. that came in to that ſupper without his wedding-garment; and what was his welcome? <hi>friend how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> Indeed he is called by the name of <hi>friend,</hi> becauſe happily hee would needs ſeeme to bee ſo; or elſe it is onely uſed as a word of courſe, as we uſe to ſpeak to a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:233:125"/> ſtranger and ſay, <hi>My friend,</hi> but yet though he had a <hi>friends title</hi> he had but a <hi>foes welcome.</hi> And ſuch welcome muſt they looke for that being not Gods friends will bee impudently thruſting into the Lords Table. Oh happy man whom Chriſt ſhall cheere up in the Sacrament, and bid him eate and drinke, and tell him that hee is heartily welcome to him. Would wee then have this happineſſe? looke to it then, and labour for it to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his friends. Chriſts friends and onely they are and ſhall bee welcome to him. A man is not fit to goe to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if he be not friends with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and before hee come he muſt ſeeke to be friends, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 23, 24. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more concernes it men to bee Gods friends, to be in termes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God before they come to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in a <hi>Time of common calamity.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in a time of feare and diſtreſſe. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may caſt a man into ſuch times as thoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 25, 26. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the earth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of nations with perplexity, mens hearts failing them for feare, and for looking after thoſe things which are comming upon the</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:233:125"/> 
                     <hi>earth.</hi> When ſuch a time ſhall come that mens hearts ſhall faile them for feare, how happy ſhall they bee that ſhall have a friend in Heaven, that ſhall not faile them, when their owne hearts faile them? At ſuch a time what will a friend in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be worth to a man in ſuch a caſe? The ſaying is that a <hi>friend at Court is better then a penny in a mans purſe.</hi> To be ſure at ſuch a time, a friend in heaven, and to have God in Heaven to be our friend is better then all the money in a mans bags. When ſuch times of diſtreſſe, and calamity come, God ſtill exempts ſome from common calamities, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36. <hi>Watch yee therefore, and pray alwaies that yee may bee accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſſe.</hi> Therefore when thoſe things ſhould come to paſſe there ſhould be ſome that ſhould be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to eſcape them. And who are they likely to be? Surely none likelier then Gods friends. If God will hide, and exempt any, he will doe it for his friends. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the friend of God. God tels <hi>Abraham</hi> of a ſore calamity that ſhould befall his poſterity. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Know of a ſurety that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:233:126"/> 
                     <hi>in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them, and they ſhall afflict them foure hundred yeares.</hi> But how then will God deale with <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend? <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt goe to thy fathers in peace, thou ſhalt be buried in a good old age,</hi> Thou art my friend, and therefore I will take an order to hide thee, that thine eyes ſhall not ſee that calamity. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Iericho,</hi> and put all to the ſword, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 6. 25. yet <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſaved <hi>Rahab</hi> the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot alive and all her family. And what was the reaſon that he exempted her, and hers from the common calamity? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was <hi>Iſraels</hi> friend, and ſhewed her ſelfe a faithfull friend to them in the buſineſſe of the ſpies. So when God brings a generall calamity upon a place, and a people, he looks out in ſuch a place who are his friends, and takes order for their ſafety, and exemption of them from the common danger. <hi>A man that hath friends muſt ſhew himſelfe friendly, Prov.</hi> 17. 17. And herein the Lord ſhewes himſelfe friendly in taking ſpeciall care for the ſafety of his friends in the caſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, Prov.</hi> 18. 10. And they that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:233:126"/> get into that Tower they are ſafe what ever comes. And who be they that have admiſſion into that Tower? <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous runne into it, and are ſafe.</hi> The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are Gods friends, and the gate of that Tower ſtands open to Gods friends. God provides a Tower, and a place of refuge for his friends. None can looke for admiſſion into that Tower but ſuch as are the friends of God. In a time of danger, how great a priviledge is it to have the liberty of entrance into that Tower? As wee prize that, ſo prize this priviledge of being the friends of God.</p>
                  <p>A third time is the <hi>Time of death.</hi> When death comes, that turnes a man out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> houſe, and home, that takes a man from all his friends, then hee muſt leave all his friends hee hath in this world. Oh how happy is that man that when all his friends muſt leave him, and hee leave them, hath the Lord God for his friend! It is a ſad thing to part with all a mans friends at his death, and to goe utterly friendleſſe out of the world: but thats the happy condition of ſuch as are Gods friends, when all their friends muſt leave
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:233:127"/> them, then will God ſticke cloſeſt to them, and that which parts a man and his deareſt friends in the world ſhall joyne them and their beſt friend together. Death parts not God and his friends, it doth but bring them home to their friends houſe. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt which is beſt of all, Philip.</hi> 1. Death makes a diſſolution of ſoule and body, but this diſſolution makes way for a bleſſed union with Chriſt. <hi>All things are yours</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>death is yours,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22. Death theirs? what privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is that? is not death any mans? no. Wicked men, death is not theirs; but they are deaths, <hi>Let death ſeaze upon them, Pſal.</hi> 55 15. <hi>Death feeds upon them. Pſal.</hi> 49. 14. But for godly men that are Gods friends, death is theirs, theirs to doe them ſervice, theirs to doe them the beſt good turne that was ever done them, to open the doore into their beſt friends houſe, to bring them to the preſence of their friend after whoſe ſociety ſo long they have longed: for they that have lived Gods friends ſhall die Gods friends, and God will be their friend in, at, and after their death for ever. So happy it is to have God
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:233:127"/> and Chriſt our friends. And therefore as our Saviour ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>And I ſay unto you, make to your ſelves friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſſe, that when you faile they may receive you into everlaſting habitations;</hi> So in this caſe, I ſay unto you, make to your ſelves friends of the God of Heaven, and the Lord Chriſt his Sonne, that when ye faile, and all your friends in the world faile, and death ſhall part you from all other friends, and ſhall turne you out of houſe and home, they may receive you into everlaſting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All this conſidered be wee awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſtirred up to make God our friend.</p>
                  <p>God having honoured us ſo highly as to make us his friends, let it be our care <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to take heed of all ſuch things as may any way craze or cruſh friendſhip with God: bee carefull to maintaine friendſhip with God, and doe that which may continue, and keepe us his friends. And that ſtands in theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In making worthy of Gods acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>and friendſhip.</hi> A man that is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into the friendſhip, and familiarity of men of ranke, and quality, they being
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:233:128"/> pleaſed to honour him with their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he will be wondrous careful to carry himſelfe ſuitably. If hee carry himſelfe baſely, men of faſhion will diſcarde him, and ſhake him off as a fellow unworthy of their friendſhip, becauſe the diſhonour of his courſes will reflect upon them his friends. How carefull thinke wee, was <hi>Zabud</hi> to carry himſelfe nobly, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and fairely, that ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> might not have any impeachment by him? If <hi>Zabud</hi> being <hi>Salomons</hi> friend ſhould have gone to hedging and ditching, to plough and cart, ſpecially if hee had beene an haunter of ale-houſes, a drunkard, a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companion, would <hi>Salomon</hi> ſtill have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him into his friendſhip? would he not rather being aſhamed of him, have caſt him off? Therefore queſtionleſſe <hi>Zabud</hi> was very carefull to carry himſelfe worthy of the honour of the Kings friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to doe nothing that might miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeme and unbecome the man that was the Kings friend. Thus muſt it be with us, if Gods friends. If God have honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us ſo much as to make us his friends, then be wee carefull to keepe in with God, and to walke ſo worthy of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:233:128"/> as that God diſclaime us not. What? Gods friends, and bee debaucht drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards? Gods friends, and prophane ones? Gods friends, and uncleane perſons? ſuite ſuch carriages with ſuch an honour? <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God, Heb.</hi> 11. 16. and to bee called their friend, but if they had beene ſuch kinde of perſons as thoſe, hee would have beene aſhamed of them. This is the next way to make God aſhamed of us, and utterly to caſt us off for being his friends. God will owne no ſuch for his friends; yea there is nothing that more diſhonours God, and moves him more to diſpleaſure then this, when ſuch as profeſſe themſelves his friends ſhall walke ſo baſely, as that he ſuffers by it. If a man have a friend that hee makes much of, that is of his inward acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and hee behave himſelfe baſely and diſhoneſtly, doe not that mans ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lay his friend in his diſh, and twit him with him and ſay, This is your friend, the man that you are ſo familiar and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward withall? And thus is God diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured when men ſhall take occaſion by the evill lives of ſuch as profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Gods friends, to ſay, oh theſe bee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:233:129"/> the men that bee Gods friends, theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth be the Lords favourites. And when God ſuffers ſuch diſhonour by us, what can wee looke for but to loſe his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? how can wee hold in with him, and thinke hee ſhould owne us for his friends, when wee cauſe dirt to be flung into his face?

If we once let fall our affections to God, and let the ſtream of them runne another way, he will have done with us, and wee looſe a friend of him. We ſee it is ſo with friends amongſt men: if a man have had ever ſo deere a friend in the ſweeteneſſe of whoſe ſociety hee hath beene much delighted, and their hearts have beene cloſe knit, yet if hee ſee his friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to bee remiſſe, and that hee ſits looſe, and communion is entertained with another, with the neglect, and a ſlighting diſ-regard of the firſt, yea with an excluſion of him, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes but a ſlaking of his affections thus ſlighted, excluded, and neglected? In like manner, if God ſees our affections cooling, and ſlaking, and new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances taken up, and wee and our new friend, never well but when together, and cloſely together, and himſelfe ſcarce minded or looked after, God will in ſuch a caſe caſheere us, and out us, hee will have nothing to doe with ſuch ſlippery, leviculous, and fickle fancied friends.

A man that either is or meanes ſeriouſly to be, and continue another mans friend, will bee kinde and friendly to all his friends, and will make thoſe his friends whom hee ſees to affect for his choyce friends. Great was the friendſhip that was betweene <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan.</hi> And <hi>Ionathan</hi> being <hi>Davids</hi> friend, <hi>David</hi> ſhewes a great deale of kindneſſe unto <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſake. On the other ſide, this is that which will <hi>ſeparate very friends,</hi> or as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes in that caſe, <hi>chiefe friends, Prov.</hi> 16. 28. When a man ſhall ſlight, and ſet light by his friends friends, eſpecially if hee ſhall oppoſe and hate thoſe whom hee cordially affects. We will not, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cloſe kindly with thoſe that ſlight our deareſt friends, though they ſeeme to deſire our friendſhip ever ſo much, it is a provocation to enmity, and cannot but breed ill blood. Now thus it is here: all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:233:132"/> Gods people are his friends; if we would hold in and maintaine friendſhip with God, we muſt be friends, kinde and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial friends to them.

But how can this be? Iudge by your ſelves. Let a man make a common practiſe of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abuſing your friends, and will you count ſuch your friends, and will you hold friendſhip with them? Nay, though you have counted them your friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet upon ſuch carriage you will let fall affection to them.

Friends communicate their ſecrets to their friends, and how ſhall a man truſt him with his ſecrets, who being a friend to his enemy will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them to him againe. <hi>Zabud</hi> was <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamons</hi> friend. <hi>Salomon</hi> had three ſpeciall enemies, <hi>Hadad, Rezon,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.

But <hi>Zabud</hi> being <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> friend, his wiſeſt courſe was to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:233:134"/> a profeſt enemy to all theſe, if hee were then living at that time. Let a man ſet ever ſo good a face upon it, and make ever ſo deepe proteſtations of love, yet if hee cloſe and knit with our profeſſed enemies, wee can have the wit not to truſt him nor to judge him any of our truſty friends. It is ſo in this caſe; If wee hold comportment, and entireneſſe with Gods enemies, hee will ſoone have done with us, and leave us to our new acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hee will ſhake us off, hee will truſt us for none of his friends. Take heed of cloſing with Gods enemies, whether they be <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>things.</hi> Take heed of cloſing in friendſhip, and falling into familiarity with wicked <hi>perſons.</hi> We know how <hi>Iehu</hi> pincht <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2. when hee made a league of friendſhip with <hi>Ahab, Wouldſt thou helpe the wicked, and love them that hate the Lord?</hi> As if he had ſaid, what?

The Iewes malignantly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our Saviour, that hee was a <hi>friend of Publieanes and ſinners,</hi> becauſe hee tooke occaſion by common converſe with them to doe them good, but otherwiſe he was no friend to them in their ſinfull courſes,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:233:135"/> he delighted not in friendſhip, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſociety with their perſons. Now if hee had ſo beene a friend to Publicanes, and ſinners, they had had ſome thing juſtly againſt him. If we be Gods friends, we muſt in this ſenſe take heed of being <hi>friends to Publicans and ſinners,</hi> of being entire friends and companions of ſinfull, and ungodly perſons. Wee know how the Jewes daſht <hi>Pilates</hi> good intentions towards Chriſt, when hee would have ſtood his friend to let him goe free, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 12. <hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Caeſars friend,</hi> and we ſee how it wrought with him <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>When Pilate heard that ſaying, he brought Ieſus forth, and ſate downe in the Iudgement-ſeate, &amp;c.</hi> Rather then hee will give the leaſt ſuſpition that hee was not <hi>Caeſars friend,</hi> hee will not bee <hi>Chriſts friend.</hi> If thou bee his friend, thou art none of <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend. It is ſo here alſo. If thou be a friend of wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones thou art none of Gods friend, he will renounce thee for being any of his friends. If thou wilt be Gods friend thou muſt make Gods enemies thine. Thou muſt doe as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139, 21, 22. <hi>Doe not I hate them O Lord, that hate thee, and am</hi>

                     <hi>not I grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord thou haſt honoured mee to be one of thy friends, and therefore I have made thine enemies mine.</p>
                  <p>Take heed alſo of friendſhip with wicked <hi>things.</hi> Every luſt is an enemy to God. <hi>The miſorder of the fleſh is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.

Every luſt is an enemy to God, and enmity to God. An enemy may bee reconciled, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity cannot bee reconciled. If therefore wee cloſe with our luſts, and make them our friends, it will utterly cracke friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip betweene God and us. If wee hold friendſhip with them, wee looſe it with God. See how the Apoſtle ſpeakes. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Ye adulterers, and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will bee a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> Love of the world is adultery.

Lay a ſide mutuall viſitations, and conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and without a quarrell friendſhip will decay. And hence is the proverbe of <hi>Amicitia Academica,</hi> univerſity friendſhip, that holds onely for a time. Schollers in the Univerſity are many times great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, very familiar loving friends, but afterwards when they come to bee diſperſt abroad into remote parts each from other the grow ſtrangers one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe being farre and long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one from another, and entercourſe of friendſhip ceaſing in mutuall viſits, walkings and talkings together their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance dies. The caſe is the ſame here: Abſence from God, diſuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of communion with him, not frequenting Gods company, and the not often reſorting to him and ſpeaking to him will let our acquaintance fall with him, will diſſolve our friendſhip
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:233:137"/> with him. It muſt bee our care then to maintaine our friendſhip and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him by our frequent commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and converſe with him, by often and daily viſiting of him: bee often at his houſe, bee frequent in praying, hearing, reading, and meditation: be frequent in thy ſoliloquies with him. <hi>God meets thoſe that remember him in his waies, Iſai.</hi> 64. 5. That is, in his ordinances which are the waies in which God walkes, and is to bee met with. Viſit thoſe waies and walks, and there often meete with God: the more this is done, the better and firmer friends ſhall God and we be, and the more diſuſe and diſcontinuance, of thoſe things, the leſſe friendſhip. Many would bee in the number of Gods friends, and yet ſeldome are at his houſe, and ſeldome in private with him, ſeldome viſit him, except it be at a pinch when they know not how to ſhift it. Alaſſe this will not goe, nor ſerve the turne amongſt men. If one profeſſe great and more then ordinary friendſhip to another, and yet never ſpeakes to him but when hee meetes him at the Church, or at market, never comes at his houſe, never viſits him, ſits with him, nor hath
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:233:137"/> any private conference with him, no man will judge ſuch a man a friend. A good quiet peaceable neighbour may hee be, but not an intire friend. If wee would maintaine acquaintance with God, wee muſt come often to him, and bee often in private with him, and the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. True it is, that there is a wiſedome and diſcretion to be uſed amongſt friends amongſt men. Though a man have a good friend that loves him deerely, yet a man may bee troubleſome to him and burthenſome to him by comming too often to him.

There is nothing ſo cuts a friend to the heart as that, and ſo ſoone cuts aſunder the bonds of friendſhip. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 12, 13. <hi>For it was not an enemy that reproached mee, then I could have borne it, &amp;c.

Obad.</hi> 7. <hi>They that have eate thy bread, the men of thy bread have layd a wound under thee.</hi> There is a great deale of wiſedome, and canonicall Truth in that Apocryphall paſſage. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>Though thou dreweſt a ſword at thy friend, yet diſpaire not, for there may bee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to favour: if thou haſt opened thy mouth againſt thy friend feare not, for there may bee a reconciliation: except for upbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or pride, or diſcloſing of ſecrets or a</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous wound, for <hi>for theſe things every friend will depart.</hi> When out of fickleneſſe of ſpirit a new friend is choſen, and that not onely with the deſertion of the old, but beſides there is a great deale of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and underhand falſe dealing with a ſpice of malignity: this will unſoder the cloſeſt friends, this will <hi>ſeparate very friends indeed.</hi> So here: Gods beſt friends may have, and often have their faylings, upon which God many times may give them ſome round language, and may make him fall out with them, but yet for all that he will keepe friends with them ſtill. But if men begin once to fall off from God, and ſhall chooſe ſome other new friend, ſo as an imputation is caſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:233:139"/> upon God, as if the new choyce were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and errours and falſe religions are ſo embraced as that there is an undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the truth with ſome tacke of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; this is treachery, this is a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wound, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Surely as a wife treacherouſly departes from her husband,</hi> or as the originall hath it, <hi>from her friend,</hi> ſo have <hi>ye dealt treacherouſly with me, O houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This the Lord cannot digeſt. Seldome doe wee ſee ſuch ever recover friendſhip with God againe. Apoſtaſie is treachery, and it is that which God takes ſo unkindly, and layes it ſo to heart, as he knowes not how to ſwallow it. It is that wee ſee amongſt men that makes an incurable rupture of friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Take heed of doing that which</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                     <hi>thou knoweſt will vex, anger, and provoke the Lord.</hi> That's the next way to looſe any mans friendſhip. If I know the doing of ſuch a thing will vexe and provoke a friend, and yet vext let him be, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved I will doe it, this will ſhatter friends aſunder, friendſhip cannot hold in ſuch a caſe. This is a diſſecation, a chopping, and cutting of friendſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:233:139"/> So when wee know that ſuch a thing will vexe, and anger God whoſe friends wee ſay wee are, and yet will doe it; this will ſoone ſunder God and us; and of a friend will make him turne our enemy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 10. <hi>But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them.</hi> How many are there that will needs bee of Gods friends, and take themſelves to bee wronged to bee otherwiſe conceived of, and yet uſe him moſt unfriendly, ſticke not to doe that which they know will deepely diſpleaſe him. How many ſay that they be Gods friends, and yet wound and ſtabbe and teare God in pieces by their horrid oathes? To ſuch may it bee ſaid, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſpake to <hi>Huſhai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend?</hi> Is this friendly dealing to ſtabbe thy friend? He that will ſtabbe a friend, doth he not ſtab and wound friendſhip? God is wounded, ſtabbed, and pierced by mens oathes and blaſphemies, as it is ſaid of the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. <hi>That hee pierced God.</hi> And how comes God by theſe wounds, who gives him theſe ſtabbes? Surely the Lord may take up thoſe words, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>Theſe</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:233:140"/> 
                     <hi>bee the wounds with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends.</hi> Now was it not enough, that Chriſt <hi>was wounded for our tranſgreſſions. Iſai.</hi> 53. but that men will profeſſe themſelves his friends, and yet wound him with their tranſgreſſions, and their piercing blaſphemies? I will not, nor dare not ſay that ſuch as theſe are Gods friends, but yet even ſuch as doe thus, doe ſay of themſelves that they are his friends. And what! you Gods friends, and prophane and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Gods Name? you Gods friends? nay the divels rather. But ſuppoſe you were his friends, could it be poſſible that your friendſhip ſhould hold when his bleſſed Name is ſo horribly abuſed by you? No ſuch matter, but a friend ſo uſed by doing that you know will vexe him, wonder not at it, blame him not to ſee him prove your bitter enemy.</p>
                  <p>It is a point of great comfort to Gods <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> people. No men, many times, ſo friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as they; none more enemies, none fewer friends. But what ever friends they want on earth, they have a great and a good friend in Heaven. No reaſon then to be diſconſolate in the want of worldly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:233:140"/> friends. <hi>Why weepeſt thou,</hi> ſaies <hi>Elkanah</hi> to <hi>Hannah, am not I better to thee then ten ſonnes?</hi> why art thou ſad in the want of friends in the world? Is not God thy friend; and is not hee better to thee then all the friends in the world? As hee hath no friends that hath not God for his friend; ſo he wants not friends, that hath the Lord his friend, he is the beſt be frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man in the world.</p>
                  <p>It is matter of terrour to all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> that wrong and abuſe them. Wot yee well what you doe? Know yee not whoſe friends they are? Thinke you that their friend will put up their wrongs? Men are very ſhy of abuſing and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch as they know have great and potent friends. Oh, ſay men, if hee had not ſuch great friends, I would make him ſmart; but ſuch a great man is his great friend, and if I ſhould ſtirre againſt him, I ſhould bee cruſht, and therefore I were as good ſit ſtill, there is no medling with him, but I ſhall pull his friends upon me. Such wiſdome would not doe amiſſe in this caſe. <hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Caeſars friend,</hi> ſay they to <hi>Pilat.</hi> That was falſe, he could not have ſhewed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:233:141"/> himſelfe a better friend to <hi>Caeſar</hi> then in being a friend to Chriſt. And the better friend to Chriſt, the better friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> And the better friend <hi>Pilat</hi> had beene to Chriſt, the better friend he had beene to himſelfe, &amp; had found <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friend to himſelfe. He gave Chriſt into their hands for feare <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould not be his friend, &amp; yet for this act by Gods juſtice he after loſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> for being his friend; <hi>If thou let him goe, thou art not Caeſars friend.</hi> Nay, if thou doe not let him goe, thou art not Gods friend. Nay much more ſhould <hi>Pilat</hi> have feared to have wronged him being Gods friend. If thou wrong him <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> &amp; putteſt him to death, thou putteſt to death the deere friend of God. <hi>Have thou nothing to doe with that juſt man,</hi> ſaies his wife in her meſſage to him on the bench. And ſurely upon this very ground it had bin wiſdome for him to have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him becauſe hee was Gods friend. It is not ſafe to provoke God by the abuſe of his friends. God will make ſuch ſmart as wrong his friends. That ſame paſſage is worth our marking, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>With Moſes will I ſpeake mouth to mouth;</hi> that is, <hi>face to face,</hi> as a man <hi>ſpeakes with</hi>

                     <hi>his friend, Exod.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Wherefore then were yee not afraid to ſpeake againſt my ſervant Moſes.</hi> As if he had ſayd, you know <hi>Moſes</hi> is one of my familiar friends, and why then were you not afraid to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my friend. Doe yee thinke I will ſuffer my friend to bee abuſed? doe yee thinke that I will not ſee my friend righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Certainely I will make you know what it is to ſpeak againſt my friend. And we ſee what <hi>Miriam</hi> got by it in the ſtory, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Let her not bee as one dead of whom the fleſh is halfe conſumed, when hee comes out of his mothers wombe.</hi> That was it ſhe got by ſpeaking againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> the friend of God. And if ſo dangerous but to ſpeake againſt Gods friends, what is it then to perſecute, to ſhed the blood &amp; take away the life of Gods friends? Gods people are his friends, and therfore let their enemies take heed how they wrong them. That wilbe the plague of ſuch as are enemies to Gods friends that is threatned againſt the enemies of <hi>Ieruſalem, Zech.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>Their fleſh ſhall conſume away while they ſtand upon their feet, and their eyes ſhall conſume away in their holes, and their tongues ſhall conſume away in their mouth.</hi> God will rot thoſe hands,

                     <hi>others, yet godly and gracious hearts will keep themſelves free from the defilement of their pitch, and from the infection of their poyſon.</hi> For many walke of whom I have told you often, &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Though many, even <hi>Multitudes multitudes</hi> as <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 14. have their converſation on earth, are very belly-gods, earth-wormes, muck-worms, yet our converſation is in heaven. If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, and families will runne a whooring after ſtrange Gods, yet <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and his houſe will ſerve the Lord. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>But as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> It was an evill generation in which <hi>Noah</hi> lived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 11. 12. <hi>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence, all fleſh had corrupted his way upon earth.</hi> And yet <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Noah was a juſt man, and upright in his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> There never lived worſe generations then in <hi>Noahs</hi> time. The great praiſe of <hi>Noah</hi> is not ſo much that he was a <hi>juſt man,</hi> as that hee was <hi>juſt and upright in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> in vile and wicked times that though hee lived in corrupt times, and generations when, as ſome thinke, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was ſet up, and Gods worſhip was corrupt, and mens manners and lifes were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:233:145"/> miſerably corrupt, yet in thoſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hee was juſt and upright. It is an hard thing for a man to be hayle &amp; ſound in a corrupt, and unwholeſome ayre. To live in the Fennes and Marſhes, and yet not to be ſicke and crazy, it is an argument of a ſtrong and good conſtitution indeed. To bee good when all men are good, is not ſo great a matter. When goodneſſe and godlineſſe is in faſhion, though it bee very rare and ſeldome that ſo good a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion comes up, yet when it doth come in faſhion, many may ſeeme to bee good and godly, if it be but to be in the faſhion. But when goodneſſe and religion is quite out of faſhion, and is as ridiculous as a dreſſe, and a weare out of faſhion, then to be good, godly, and religious, thats the great matter indeed, that is the thing that is praiſe-worthy, and commendable indeed. And ſo it is with ſuch as are godly indeed. They will bee godly in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of ungodly generations, they will be upright in the middeſt of corrupt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. <hi>Noah was upright in his generations.</hi> It is no wonder to ſee freſh fiſh in freſh waters, but all the wonder is to ſee freſh fiſh in the ſalt ſea. This world is oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:233:146"/> to the Sea in Scriptures, and it is not onely a <hi>ſalt ſea,</hi> but a <hi>dead ſea</hi> like the lake into which <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> were turned, in which they ſay no fiſh can live but die ſo ſoone as thither they come. But godly men are ſuch as not onely keepe freſh in the ſalt, but keepe alive in the dead ſea. There is a great deale of poyſon and peſtilence in the evill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others, eſpecially when it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, and ſpred like an epidemicall plague, but yet true grace is an antidote, a ſpirituall Amulet that preſerves in times of univerſall infection, that as in that caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 7. ſo in this it may be ſaid, <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at thy right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee.</hi> The priviledge of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beleevers, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 18. <hi>They ſhall take up ſerpents, and if they drinke any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them,</hi> is and ſhould be ſtill the ſpirituall priviledge of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that a principle of living grace ſhould ſo preſerve them, that deadly things, deadly poyſon, the deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of other mens evill example ſhould not hurt them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Though Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Iudah ſinne.</hi> Nay more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:233:146"/> then ſo, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Ephraim compaſſeth me about with lies, and the houſe of Iſrael with deceit, but Iudah yet rules with God, and is faithfull with the Saints.</hi> It is amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers one ſpeciall note of <hi>pure religion,</hi> as the Apoſtle calles it, <hi>for a man to keepe him ſelfe unſpotted of the world, Iam.</hi> 1. 27. There be religions that will give a man leave to wallow in any mire and puddles of the world; but <hi>pure Religion,</hi> and powerfull Religion keeps it ſelfe not only from the puddles, and kennels, but from the very <hi>ſpots</hi> of the worlds mire. Grace to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is as the ſap to the bowes growing on the tree; ſo long as a bow growes on the tree, and receives ſap from the roote, ſo long it receives no wet, though the raine fall often upon it; but when a branch is cut off from the tree, and the ſap dryed up, then the dew and the raine ſoakes and ſinkes into it, and it ſoone rots with the water ſoaking into it. It is ſo with Chriſtians that have the ſappe of grace from Chriſt their roote: that ſappe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them from the taking in of ſuch moyſture as would breed rottenneſſe. There is not a better evidence of a mans ſappe, and life from Chriſt then his not

The Arabians and other heathens had a faſhion and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in their mournings for the dead to cut themſelves, and to make themſelves balde: now God hee forbids his people to conforme to thoſe faſhions of their neighbour heathens, and marke upon what ground he doth it <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1, 2. <hi>The Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people to himſelfe, ye ſhall not cut yourſelves, nor make any baldneſſe betweene your eyes for the dead.</hi> As if he had ſaid, you are a peculiar people in my love, therefore I will have you a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people in your carriage, I will not have you conforme your ſelves to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh courſes and cuſtomes, no though it be but in matter of cutting your haire, but I will have you croſſe their courſes, and cuſtomes.

Looke where a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation moſt is, there a man may bee ſayd to dwell, and therefore they are ſayd to dwell there, becauſe their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is moſt there. <hi>David</hi> deſires <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. that <hi>hee may dwell in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> But now no man did dwell in the Temple, why then doth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſire to dwell there?

See what is added, <hi>made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Wee ſit not there onely in regard of right, but in ſome ſenſe in fact, becauſe wee doe it in Chriſt our head. Such is the union betweene Chriſt and the godly, that what hee did, they did in him. When Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, we were crucified in him and with him, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> When Chriſt was quickned, all beleevers were quickned together with him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>He hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> When he was raiſed up, all believers were raiſed up together with him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6. And when he aſcended into heaven all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers aſcended with him: and now that he lives, and ſits in heaven, all believers live, &amp; ſit in heaven with him, doing it in him who is their head. For Chriſt aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heaven, and ſits there not as a private perſon; but as the head of the Church in the Name of all the elect, and therefore that action is to bee accounted theirs. As when an inheritance is given to many brethren in a far countrey, the elder
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:233:154"/> brother goes &amp; is enſtated into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it in the name of all the reſt: all the reſt that are abſent, are poſſeſſed of the place as well as he that is bodily preſent there. It is in this caſe as it is betweene the head &amp; the members of the naturall body. Though all the body be under the water, yet if the head be above the water, wee uſe to ſay, that the man is above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So though the faithfull bee here on earth, yet Chriſt their head being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they may alſo be ſayd to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus then the godly are in heaven becauſe they be in Chriſt their head who is in heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou haſt given mee, be with mee where I am.</hi> The which as they ſhall at laſt perſonally and locally be: ſo alſo in this ſenſe they now bee whilſt on earth, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken poſſeſſion, and a ſeate in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Chriſt their head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of their faith by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which they aſcend into heaven, and ſit there with Chriſt. That looke, as it is ſaid of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. that hee <hi>calles thoſe things that bee not as if they were,</hi> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the grace of faith it makes things to bee which are not; that is, which are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:233:155"/> not to ſenſe, and are not ſeene with the eye of ſence, and nature. Therefore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Fayth is the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeene.</hi> The grace of faith doth give a nullity to things that are, as namely to the afflictions, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and mortality of this life, it makes theſe things bee as if they were not. It makes afflictions to bee no afflictions, it makes miſeries to be no miſeries, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>As dying, and yet behold we live; as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, yet not killed; as ſorrowfull, yet alwaies rejoycing, &amp;c.</hi> Now as faith gives a nullity to things exiſtent, and makes things which are, not to be. So on the contrary it gives a ſubſiſtence to things not being, and makes thoſe things to bee which are not. Thus did the faith of the beleevers under the old Teſtament make Chriſt to bee crucified unto them before hee was crucified, or come into the world. Hee was to their faith <hi>a lambe crucified from the beginning of the world,</hi> who was not indeed crucified till the latter end of the world. And thus are wee by faith already in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though here yet on earth. This is that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Knowing that you have in your ſelves a better ſubſtance in the heavens.</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:233:155"/> How could they have that ſubſtance in themſelves, and in the heavens, when they themſelves on earth? By the worke of faith which makes things to come to be already preſent. A ſubſtance in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet a ſubſtance in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves already in heaven by their faith. <hi>I live by faith;</hi> ſaies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> A Chriſtian lives by faith, and faith lives altogether above in heaven; faith lives alwaies above upon Chriſt, and with Chriſt. And therefore a Chriſtian muſt needs live in heaven, becauſe hee lives by that which lives altogether in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Faith puts the ſoule in poſſeſſion of heaven, whileſt the body is here on earth. It is with a Chriſtians faith in this caſe, as it was with <hi>Iacobs</hi> in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 22. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I have given unto thee one portion above thy brethren, which I tooke out of the hand of the Amorite with my Sword, and with my Bow.</hi> Which is not to bee underſtood of any thing that was paſt, and already done; but he ſpeaks prophetically of that which ſhould afterwards be done by his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which his faith made to him as already done, as if hee had now already conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:233:156"/> and taken poſſeſſion of it. He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the language of faith ſpeakes of a thing to be done, as paſt and done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So faith gives a man poſſeſſion of heaven whiles hee is on earth, and ſo makes him live in heaven whiles he is here on earth.</p>

A man is not ſo much where his body is, as where his heart is. And a mans heart is not ſo much where his body is, as where his love and affections and deſires are. Love and deſire carry a mans heart thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where the things loved and deſired are. <hi>Where the treaſure is, there is the heart, Matth.</hi> 6. Where the treaſure is that is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and deſired, there the heart is which loveth and deſireth. A man is not ſo much ſaid to bee any where ſo much in reſpect of <hi>poſition</hi> of place, as of <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And the ſoule is not where it <hi>lives,</hi> but where it <hi>loves,</hi> yea there it lives where it loves. Thus therefore have the godly their converſation in heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:233:156"/> they have their hearts there, their affections are raiſed, and mounted up into heaven, they minde heaven, and heavenly things; their deſires, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging affections are altogether there. So much is here implyed in the Apoſtles op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>They mind earthly things, but our converſation is in heaven.</hi> The oppoſition one would have thought ſhould rather have runne thus, they minde earthly things. But wee minde heavenly things, but in ſtead of this hee ſaies, <hi>our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in heaven.</hi> So that to have a mans converſation in heaven is to minde hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, to have his heart, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in heaven. What this converſation in heaven is we may ſee, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. 2. <hi>Seeke the things that are above.</hi> Above? where is that above? In heaven, <hi>above in heaven where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Set your affection on things above.</hi> Still above, a Chriſtians thoughts and affections are ſtill above, and ſo hee converſes above in heaven. Thus had <hi>Abraham</hi> his converſation in heaven. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>He looketh for a City which hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> How looked he for that City? with much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:233:157"/> affection and deſire, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 16. <hi>They ſeeke a Countrey, they deſire an heavenly Countrey.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs had their converſations in heaven by having their minds after heaven. Excellent is that deſcription of the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Who is this that comes or aſcends up out of the Wilderneſſe like pillars of ſmoake?</hi> The world is a wilderneſſe, a Chriſtian hee is comming up out of the wilderneſſe, he is always aſcending up out of the wildernes, he is raiſing, and lifting up his heart into heaven, and he <hi>aſcends like pillars of ſmoake.</hi> Smoke we ſee ariſes, and aſcends in the forme of a pillar, and it goes upward to heaven. So a Chriſtian hath his heart alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the world, hee is ever aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up out of that wilderneſſe; and ſuch are the deſires, and affections of his heart after heaven, that they aſcend up like ſmoake, like pillars, elations, and liftings up of ſmoake to heaven. When the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſet <hi>Ai</hi> on fire, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>The men of Ai looked behind them, and they ſaw and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ſmoake of the City aſcended up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> So ſuch are the affections and deſires of the godly after heaven, that their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections reeke and ſmoke, and goe up in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:233:157"/> pillars of ſmoake to heaven. Now when thus the ſoule of a man is lifted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into heaven, in his affections and deſires; when his heart thus reekes and ſmoakes towards heaven, then is a mans converſation in heaven. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to bee with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> Now when a mans heart hath continuall riſings and heavings up hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, when a mans ſpirit aſpires, breathes, pants after the preſence of God in heaven, then a man may bee ſaid to have his converſation in heaven. See <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> expreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 18. <hi>O Lord, I have waited for thy ſalvation.</hi> It is with Gods people as with wayters: a wayter hee ſtands without at the gate, or doore of the houſe, but his heart, his deſires are within doores, hee repreſents to himſelfe his being within, his ſpeech, diſcourſe, carriage and behaviour there, and ſo is within whiles he is without. So is it with godly men, they waite for ſalvation, waite for heaven, and though yet whiles here they be without, yet in their minds, affections, and deſires they are within.</p>
                  <p>The woman that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 1. had <hi>the Moone under her feete.</hi> The godly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:233:158"/> live above the Moone, above all ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things. Theſe things are beneath their affections, their affections are aloft above the Moone, and they that have the Moone under their feet, are in an higher region then the earth; they have their converſation in heaven, by having their affections above all earthly things.</p>
                  <p>Many when they are in the publique aſſemblies, and at a ſermon hearing the word, yet they may bee ſaid to have their converſation in their ſhops, and in their fields, becauſe their hearts, minds, and affections be there. So in this caſe, the godly may be ſaid to be in heaven whilſt on earth, becauſe there bee their hearts and affections. The godly may be ſaid to be in heaven whileſt they are on earth, as the Iſraelites were ſaid to bee in Egypt whilſt they were in the wilderneſſe. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>They returned into Egypt.</hi> I, but they never came backe into Egypt, how then is it ſayd that they returned into Egypt? <hi>They returned,</hi> ſayes the text, <hi>into Egypt in their hearts.</hi> Becauſe their hearts affections and deſires were in Egypt, therefore they are ſaid to returne into Egypt. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in their hearts, and with their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:233:158"/> hearts, though not with their feete. So the godly, though on earth, yet they are in heaven, &amp; have their converſation there, becauſe they bee gone up thither in their hearts and affections. <hi>This people,</hi> ſaies the Prophet, <hi>drawes nigh unto mee with their lips, but their hearts are farre from me.</hi> So here, on the contrary, This people is farre from mee with their bodies, but their hearts draw nigh unto me, and are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in heaven with me.</p>
                  <p>And as they are thus in heaven by their affections and deſires, ſo unto this head may bee joyned, that they are in heaven in regard of their meditations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations. He that aſcends, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently goes up into heaven, may be ſaid to have his converſation there.

                     <hi>ſeeke.</hi> And as his face is to be ſought, ſo his face is to be ſeene in his ordinances. See how <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 2. my fleſh longeth to ſee thy power, and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeene thee in thy ſanctuary, 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. <hi>Hee that doth evill hath not ſeene God:</hi> he ſaies not, he ſhall not ſee, but hath not ſeene. That implies, that good and godly perſons they doe ſee, and have ſeene God in the Word, Prayer, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Godly people ſee God, and behold his face, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>And they ſhall ſee his face.</hi> But when is it they ſhall ſee it? Lay the latter end of the former verſe to it, <hi>And his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face.</hi> That is, even then when, &amp; whileſt they ſerve him, even in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in Prayer, the Word, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In theſe holy ſervices Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſee his face. And ſo alſo they have heavenly and ſweete fellowſhip with God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the father, and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>The King hath brought me into his chambers:</hi> not the King <hi>will</hi> bring me into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but he <hi>hath</hi> brought me in. It is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that ſweet and ſecret communion which the Saints here have with God.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:233:161"/> The publique aſſemblies are Gods houſe, and his Pallace, but heaven is Gods chamber. Now the godly are not onely admitted into the publique aſſemblies unto holy duties, but in the publique aſſemblies in the duties of praying, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and receiving the Sacrament, God takes them into his chamber, into heaven in regard of that ſweet and ſecret fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that he vouchſafes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in holy duties. And ſo they being in Gods chamber, in Gods privy-chamber, in his bedchamber, <hi>Alſo our bed is greene;</hi> where are they but in <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 16</note> heaven? They that have their converſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Gods cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, in his very bed-chamber, they have their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſation in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus the godly here ſeeing Gods face, here having communion with God, they have here in degree the happineſſe of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the happineſſe of heaven ſtands in the peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. This is heaven, and hee that hath this in him hath heaven in him, and he that hath heaven within him may bee well ſaid to be in heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdome of God,</hi> and ſo the Kingdome of heaven is <hi>peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt:</hi> where theſe are, there hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:233:161"/> is. That looke as on the contrary, where there is an accuſing conſcience that filles the heart with feares, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, horrour and anguiſh, there are the very flaſhings of hell fire, and ſuch a man may be ſaid to be in hell, in the belly of hell, as <hi>Ion.</hi> 2. ſo here where there is joy of the holy Ghoſt, ſweete peace ariſing from faith, and the aſſurance of Gods love in pardon of ſinne, there is heaven; and ſuch a man truely lives in heaven. The joyes of heaven in Scripture are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſet forth by a feaſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Bleſſed is he that eates bread in the Kingdome of God.</hi> And ſo the rich man ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſom, that is, he ſaw him at the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed feaſt in heaven, ſet at Gods Table in an high place next to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> leaned in Chriſts boſome at the laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 23. Thus alſo is the peace of a good conſcience ſet forth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 15. by a feaſt. <hi>A good conſcience is a continuall feaſt:</hi> what is it to be in heaven, but to be as at a bleſſed feaſt? at a bleſſed feaſt are they that have peace of conſcience, as they are that are in heaven. Here is a ſitting, a lying in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> nay in Chriſts boſome. And therefore we ſhall ſee the ſame thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:233:162"/> of peace, and joy in this life, that is of that peace and joy that is in heaven. What is the peace that is in heaven? At the utmoſt no more can bee ſayd of it, then that it is a peace that paſſes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And ſo much is ſaid of the peace of God, and the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that here the Saints have on earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>The peace of God that paſſes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> This peace they have here tranſcends all comprehenſion. No under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is able to underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the peace of a good conſcience, it paſſes all underſtanding A mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can underſtand great comfort, it muſt needs therefore be a great comfort indeed which no mans underſtanding can conceive. If a man would ſtrive to covet, no covetous man can covet more riches then his underſtanding can conceive. If a man ſhould ſtrive to be ambitious; no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man can deſire more preferments, and honours, then his underſtanding can conceive. The conceiving of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the utmoſt bounds of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But the peace of God ſurmounts theſe bonds, <hi>It paſſes all underſtanding.</hi> A man ſtrives to get a good living, to get a good
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:233:162"/> revenew, and maintenance, now I can eaſily underſtand how much thou getteſt. It may be twenty pounds, or an hundred, or a thouſand, or an hundred thouſand by the yeere, I can eaſily underſtand all this. Nay if it were as many thouſands by the yeere as there bee haires on thine head, which no man hath, yet all this I can eaſily underſtand; but now I cannot ſo much as conceive with mine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the worth and happineſſe of the peace of a good conſcience. This paſſes all underſtanding, not onely the underſtanding of men, but the underſtanding of Angels. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man the things that God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. It is ſpoken not of the joyes of heaven, but of the comforts of the Goſpel which it brings to the conſcience, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the context. Now thine eye, ſaies <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> hath ſeene many things, and thine eare heard more then thou haſt ſeene, and thine heart can imagine more then thou haſt heard; and yet, neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare heard, neither can it enter into thine heart to imagine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:233:163"/> what God hath provided for thee in the peace of a good conſcience. A man may ſuppoſe what hee could imagine, hee might imagine a man to have a thouſand worlds if there were ſo many, and to have the command over all the men in the world. A man may imagine that he hath Kings and Princes to ſerve him, you may imagine a man to live millions of yeeres without ſickneſſe, without grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances without any diſcontent; yee may imagine ſuch a man, but yee can never imagine what is the happineſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that man that hath the peace of God that paſſes all underſtanding. What now can bee ſaid more of the peace in heaven? So likewiſe what is the joy that is in heaven, what kinde of joy is it? It is a joy exceeding glorious, an unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ineffable, unſpeakeable joy. Such is the very joy that Gods people have in this life. There is a twofold joy. A joy of <hi>faith</hi> here, and a joy of <hi>fruition</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now as the joy of fruition is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, is unſpeakeable; ſo is the joy of faith here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Yee believing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakeable, and full of glory.</hi> What more glorious thing can be ſpoken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:233:163"/> of the joyes of heaven? what can a man have in heaven more then glorious joy? more then unſpeakeable joy? the grace of joy is a glorious joy. They that have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unſpeakeable joy where live they but in heaven? It is true there is ſome difference betweene joyes here, and in heaven. Now this joy is <hi>in us,</hi> then we ſhall be <hi>in it,</hi> now this joy <hi>enters into us,</hi> then wee ſhall enter into it, <hi>enter into thy maſters joy.</hi> All the difference is onely the meaſure and the degree, there wee ſhall have more, but it is all of one kind. Thus the Saints have heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and ſo having the happineſſe of heaven here, they have their converſe in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a great part of the happineſſe of heaven is in thoſe bleſſed raptures of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſpirit, and Raviſhing extaſies that the bleſſed Saints in heaven have. Whileſt they are taken up with the contemplation of Gods infinit wiſedome and mercy in Chriſt they are quite carried out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The wiſedome and mercy of God in Chriſt ſhall bee a ſpeciall theame and ſubject of the meditations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the Saints in heaven unto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:233:164"/> all eternities. They ſhall be taken up with the contemplation of their owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now they ſhall be ſo taken up with theſe things that they ſhall have bleſſed raviſhments of their ſpirits in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations. That looke as the damned in hell under the ſenſe of preſent wrath, and in the contemplation and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eternity of it, and under the feare of future wrath are ſwallowed up in deſpaire, in horrour and conſternation of ſpirit, a thing that addes extremely to their helliſh torments, ſo there is a thing in the happineſſe of heaven contrary to that, and that is incomprehenſible glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious raviſhments of Spirit in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of their preſent, and view of their eternall bleſſedneſſe. Now even thus have the Saints on earth an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe like that in heaven. For the Saints on earth have their raptures, their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly extaſies, and raviſhments of ſpirit. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. <hi>As Chriſt prayed, the faſhion of his countenance was changed, and hee was transfigured.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>As Peter prayed he fell into a trance, and ſaw heaven opened.</hi> Nay <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 4. was rapt, was caught up into the third heavens, caught
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:233:164"/> up into paradiſe, and heard words which were not lawfull, or poſſible to be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. A man caught up into heaven, hee is in heaven, and truely converſes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>raviſhed in ſpirit on the Lords day,</hi> either in the time of his prayers or meditations on that day. Thus had all theſe their raptures, and extaſies. And though theſe were all extraordinary caſes, and not common to all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet are not the godly without rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſpirit in their kinde. They have their ſpirituall transfigurations, and in their prayers and meditations when they have their hearts in ſpeciall manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; they have their ſpirits rapt and caught up into the third heavens, and there have ſweete and comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God above. He that knowes what ſpeciall enlargements of heart are in holy duties, knowes better by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience what theſe raviſhments meane, then any man knowes how to expreſſe them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a great part of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of heaven that there the Saints live ſeparated from all evill, and wicked company. There the Wheate is ſeparated
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:233:165"/> from the chaffe, there the ſheepe are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Goates. To live and converſe in the company and ſociety of wicked and ungodly men, and to ſee their filthy converſation, their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in hell, it is a little piece of hell, it is a living in the ſuburbs of hell. It is to a godly heart, a kinde of helliſh torment. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day,</hi> vexed, or tormented. It is the ſame word that is uſed of the rich man being in the torments in hell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. But whether a man be tormented or not, it is the having of a mans converſation in hel, to live familiarly and to converſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward familiar ſociety with ungodly and prophane perſons. To bee all one with them, and to take delight in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is for a man to have his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in hell. To have ones converſation in drunken houſes, with drunken perſons, to have ones converſation with ſwearers and godleſſe perſons, what is it better then converſing in hell? Now this is an happineſſe in heaven, that there a man is ſeparated from all familiarity, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſociety of ungodly ones. There is no Canaanite in that houſe of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:233:165"/> Lord, there is no hurtfull beaſt in that mountaine of the Lord. And this is a great part of the happineſſe of heaven. It is to live in heaven to live ſeparated from wicked ones. And thus here have the godly their converſation in heaven by living ſeparated from ungodly ones in the world. Though this ſeparation bee not a <hi>locall</hi> ſeparation, yet it is a <hi>morall</hi> ſeparation, a ſeparation in manners, in affection, in ſociety, and this morall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration prepares for that locall ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus are Gods people in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in heaven, and have their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there by not having converſation and ſociety with ſuch as have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in hell. It is in heaven to live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from evill ones.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is a great part of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heaven, that there a man hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſweet and comfortable ſociety with the Saints of God. This is made a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and the Weſt, and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob in the Kingdome of God.</hi> There the Saints of God ſhall have bleſſed ſociety each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall rejoyce together in communion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:233:166"/> each with other. There ſhall be an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not onely in communion with God, but alſo in communion with the Saints. And it is an unſpeakeable ſweetneſſe that ſhall ariſe from the ſociety of the Saints in heaven. This happineſſe and comfort have the godly here now begun on earth. It is an heavenly contentment, an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly delight that they have in, and from the ſociety of Gods people. <hi>All my delight is in the Saints on earth; Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>I am companion of all them that feare thee, Pſal.</hi> 119 63. Thus by delighting and rejoycing themſelves in the ſociety of the Saints, ſorting with them, and converſing with them in the duties of the communion of Saints they doe live in heaven, and have their converſation there. It is to have ones converſation in heaven to have converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Saints in the duties of their communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the godly live in heaven whileſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they are here, becauſe whileſt they are here they live as the Saints, and Angels in heaven doe. They live in holineſſe and in obedience to God as the Saints and Angels in heaven doe, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,</hi> now they that live
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:233:166"/> holily, and obediently on earth they doe Gods will on earth as it is in heaven, and they that doe Gods will on earth as it is in heaven, they live as they doe that be in heaven, and they that live like the ſpirits in heaven they have their converſation in heaven. They may be truely ſaid to have their converſation in heaven that live an heavenly life, and they live an heavenly life that live an holy life. What be the men that be in heaven? All men that are in heaven are Saints, holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Now then when men be Saints they be inhabitants of heaven. The Apoſtle makes a diſtinction of bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 40 <hi>There are celeſtiall bodies, and bodies terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall.</hi> So I may ſay, there are celeſtiall hearts, &amp; there be hearts terreſtriall. Now when men have holy hearts, ſet upon holineſſe, ſanctified ſpirits, and lives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Gods will and truth, ſuch holy hearts are heavenly and celeſtiall hearts, and when men have celeſtiall ſpirits then they live in heaven. A maine thing in heaven is the perfection of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that there the Saints ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy. Now therefore the more holineſſe wee have, the more wee are in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:233:167"/> heaven. The way to live in, &amp; to converſe there now, is to live an holy life. <hi>Saints on earth,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> cals them <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. are already <hi>Saints in heaven,</hi> Saints that have their converſation there. The Turkes if they ſee a <hi>mad man,</hi> they honour him as a <hi>Saint,</hi> and judge him a Saint; as one that hath his minde abſtracted from, and elevated above things below, as one who in his ſpirit converſes with God. But many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us are in another extreame. If we ſee a man a <hi>Saint,</hi> one of an holy god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life wee count him a <hi>mad man.</hi> Turkes honour mad men under the notion of Saints, we hate and deſpiſe Saints under the notion of mad men. But let men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe holineſſe, and ſcorne Saints as they pleaſe, yet hee that will goe to heaven hereafter muſt live in heaven now; and he that will live in heaven now, muſt live an holy, a godly and obedient life to God. This is to have our converſation in heaven to have ſuch a converſation as that, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Let your converſation bee as becomes the Goſpell,</hi> then is our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as becomes the Goſpell, when ſuch as, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>But as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be yee holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:233:167"/> The Goſpell is from heaven, it tends to heaven, an heavenly converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore becomes it. An holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is an heavenly converſation, an holy converſation is a converſation in heaven. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>As then we would approve our ſelves true Chriſtians indeed, ſo let us thus have our converſations in heaven; let us live above, let us live on high. If a Chriſtian have his converſation in heaven, as wee would ſhew our ſelves to be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo labour for a Chriſtians conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. A Chriſtians converſation is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven, and when we have our converſation there, then wee may truely ſay, we are Chriſtians. How can we ſay that we are Chriſtians, if we have not a Chriſtians converſation? And how can we ſay that we have a Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation when we have not our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in heaven, where all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have their converſation? How can we ſay that we have a Chriſtians conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, whileſt our converſations are on earth? up therefore up into heaven, live and converſe there. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olemus ſurſum,</hi> let us flie upward, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſomewhere

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is an excellent preſervative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to ſave a man from the ſinnes, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times he lives in. <hi>Noah</hi> lived in corrupt times, and yet was a juſt and an upright man in thoſe times. How came hee to ſave himſelfe from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of thoſe times? The text ſaies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that <hi>Noah walked with God.</hi> God he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:233:169"/> is in heaven, he that walkes with God he converſes in heaven, and ſo <hi>Noah</hi> by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his converſation in heaven ſaved himſelfe from the corrupt converſations of the men on earth. What a number of thoſe that profeſſed themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> time, did live like Epicures, that made <hi>their belly their God; minded</hi> nothing but <hi>earthly things,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the verſes before this text. Now why was not the Apoſtle and the reſt of the faithfull carried away with the ſtreame of thoſe times? The reaſon was in this, <hi>But our converſation is in heaven,</hi> wee live not as they, we are not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and infected with their manners, for our converſation is in heaven. And ſo they having their converſation in heaven were ſaved from the infection of thoſe belly-gods, and mucky companions, that had their hearts and minds on the mucke of the earth. As in a common contagion of peſtilence when the very ayre is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if a man could live in the upper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ayre, hee would be above the reach of the infection, So when there be infectious peſtilences of hereſie, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ungodlineſſe, and licentiouſneſſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:233:169"/> raigning in the world, if a man have his converſation above in heaven hee lives in a region free from thoſe infections, and ſo is preſerved. As on the other ſide, when a man hath not his converſation in heaven, hee is in danger to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with any errour, or corruption what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. When Antichriſt was to come into the world, hee ſhould corrupt the doctrine of the Goſpell, hee ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt religion, and worſhip; hee ſhould ſet up idolatry, and all that was naught. And yet as vile corruptions as hee ſhould bring in, there were a number of people that ſhould receive him, and ſwallow all his corruptions, ſhould yeeld to all his idolatries, and embrace his religion. VVell, but what kinde of people ſhould they be that ſhould doe it? See <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>And all that dwell upon earth ſhall worſhip him,</hi> that is, All ſuch Chriſtians as had not their converſations in heaven, but on earth, that were worldly earthly hearted people they ſhould receive Antichriſt, and his religion, and turne Idolaters thicke and three-fold. So that an earthly hearted Chriſtian, that is <hi>a dweller on earth,</hi> and hath not his converſation in heaven,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:233:170"/> hee is in preparation for any religion. Come what will come, hee is ready to be any thing, to doe any thing; come Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, come Idolatry, come Antichriſt, come any thing, nothing comes amiſſe to ſuch an one. He that dwels on earth will worſhip the beaſt, and will doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great reluctation too. Wee ſee there, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. that Antichriſt makes warre with, and perſecutes the Saints of God. And what was the quarrell? becauſe they would not receive Antichriſt, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But how came it about that they were thus preſerved from worſhipping him, and receiving his religion? That we finde <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>They dwelt in heaven,</hi> they had their converſation in heaven, they were an heavenly minded people, and ſo the Antichriſtian peſtilence could not faſten upon them. But all <hi>that dwelt on the earth worſhips him.</hi> An earthly hearted man is a fit piece of timber to be framed to any thing that is naught; yee may hew a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, an idolater, a ſuperſtitious ſot out of him. He will be any thing before he will looſe any thing. It is a very heavie, ſore, and ſad judgement of God to be given up to embrace Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:233:170"/> 11, 12. <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſond them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned.</hi> See how <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeakes of an whore, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>I finde more bitter then death the woman whoſe heart is ſnares and nets, and her hands as bands: who ſo pleaſes God ſhall eſcape from her, but the ſinner ſhall bee taken by her,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>The mouth of a ſtrange woman is a deepe pit, hee that is abhorred of the Lord ſhall fall therein.</hi> When a man is given up to the love of an whore, it is a ſigne that he is abhorred of God, and that therefore God lets him fall into that deepe pit to breake his necke; and on the contrary a mercy of God for a man to eſcape that ditch. So it is a ſpeciall mercy of God to be ſaved, and preſerved from the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as to be given up to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of that whoore, it is a ſad ſigne that God abhorres a man, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates him into that deepe pit, to break his necke. It being ſo ſad a caſe, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes every man to looke well about him, that hee may be preſerved from that danger. Loe then here is a ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative; dwell not on earth, dwell and converſe above in heaven, and this will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:233:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> preſerve thee from falling into that deepe and dangerous ditch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> every man ſaies he would faine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> live in heaven for ever, and have his habitation there for ever. Now then, as we deſire to live in heaven for ever, ſo now have wee our converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here. Here be two things in this text, here is a <hi>converſation in heaven,</hi> and an <hi>expectation</hi> of a Saviour <hi>from heaven.</hi> And firſt a <hi>converſation</hi> in heaven before an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of a Saviour <hi>from heaven.</hi> Many profeſſe an expectation of a Saviour, and ſo of ſalvation from heaven, but in the meane time have no regard to a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven. Now in vaine is a mans expectation of a Saviour from heaven, who hath not his converſation in heaven. The converſation in heaven is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ground of the expectation of a Saviour from heaven; for marke the words, <hi>From whence</hi> wee looke for the Saviour. The Saviour is not onely looked for, but marke <hi>from whence</hi> hee is looked for. From whence then is he looked for? <hi>from heaven.</hi> I but from what heaven? our converſation is <hi>in heaven, from whence</hi> wee looke for the Saviour. Therefore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:233:171"/> the expectation of the Saviour is onely from that heaven in which a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is. So that if no converſation in heaven, then no ground for a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to expect Chriſts comming from heaven, becauſe by the context it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that they onely can comfortably expect Chriſts comming from heaven, who have firſt had their converſation in that heaven from whence they expect him a Saviour. So then eyther have thy converſation in heaven, or elſe from that heaven thou canſt not looke for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor in that heaven have ſalvation. A ſure thing it is, that hee that hath not his converſation in heaven here, ſhall never have his habitation there here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And as ſure it is, that every one that truely deſires to have his habitation in heaven hereafter, now here already hath his converſation there. If we have not our converſation in heaven now, how appeares it that wee have a deſire indeede to live in heaven hereafter? If yee have a true deſire to live in heaven hereafter, why then make yee not all the haſte yee can to bee in heaven now? As <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſpeakes to them, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>How</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:233:172"/> 
                     <hi>long are yee ſlacke to goe to poſſeſſe the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you?</hi> So I ſay, if yee have any minde in good earneſt to dwell in heaven for ever, how long are you ſlacke to take poſſeſſion of heaven now, why are yee not in it already? why are yee ſo long out of it? why have yee not your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation there, where yee profeſſe yee deſire to have your habitation for ever? That man hath no true deſire to heaven that doth not now converſe in heaven. No converſation in heaven now, no habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in heaven hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a ſweet and comfortable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> evidence that wee are riſen with Chriſt when our converſation is in heaven. There bee many that goe for Chriſtians, that are no better then Chriſtians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, that are dead and buried, that have no life in them, were never raiſed with Chriſt. And there is not a ſurer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it then this, that they have not their converſation in heaven, for they that are riſen with Chriſt are aſcended into heaven, and converſe there in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where Chriſt is, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>If yee be riſen with Chriſt ſeeke the things that are</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:233:172"/> 
                     <hi>above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, ſet your affections on things above:</hi> that is, If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſet your affections above; for thoſe words, <hi>If yee bee riſen with Chriſt,</hi> have reference alſo to the words in the ſecond verſe. As if hee had ſaid, yee can never ſet your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions above, nor ſeeke the things above, unleſſe ye be riſen with Chriſt; you muſt bee firſt riſen with Chriſt before you can have your converſation in heaven. And if you doe once ſet your affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and ſo have your converſation in heaven, then yee give a good evidence that yee are riſen againe with Chriſt. So that a man that hath not his converſation in heaven, by having his heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions raiſed up into heaven, hee is like to that Demoniacke, <hi>Marke</hi> 5. that had his dwelling and his converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the graves and ſepulchres. An unraiſed Chriſtian is ſtill in the grave, and a man that hath not his converſation in heaven is an unraiſed Chriſtian, he is not riſen with Chriſt. The Apoſtle tels us that a true Chriſtian muſt <hi>bee planted into the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſurrection. Rom.</hi> 6. 5. They that be ſpiritually raiſed, muſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:233:173"/> be raiſed like as Chriſt was raiſed. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection that is not in the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſurrection is not to bee truſted to. Some are raiſed onely in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuels</hi> reſurrection: it was not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> himſelfe, but onely a ſpirit which the witch of Endor raiſed in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Divers ſeeme to be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as if they were raiſed from the dead, but they are no better than hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the likeneſſe of true Chriſtians. Some are raiſed in the likeneſſe of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his reſurrection. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11. 44. hee was indeed raiſed, but yet hee was to die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Too many riſe in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection, of whom it may be ſaid, cleane contrary to that which the father ſpake of his prodigall ſonne, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 32. <hi>This thy brother was dead, and is alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> but of them, Theſe were alive, and are dead againe. Such is the reſurrection of Apoſtataes, and back-ſliders. But now a man that would be raiſed aright, muſt be raiſed in the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, hee muſt be raiſed like as Chriſt was raiſed. How was that? <hi>The third day hee roſe againe from the dead, hee aſcended into heaven.</hi> Chriſt after he roſe from the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:233:173"/> dead, hee aſcended up into heaven, and hath his abode there. So a man that is raiſed in the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection muſt doe, he muſt riſe and aſcend into heaven. Then a man is planted into the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſurrection, when he aſcends into heaven, then hee is aſcended into heaven when hee hath his converſation in heaven. And ſo a man that hath his converſation in heaven is planted into <hi>the likeneſſe of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> and hath alſo thereby a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable evidence that hee is riſen with Chriſt. For indeede none can riſe in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection, but thoſe that are raiſed by the <hi>power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this therefore conſidered, be wee ſtirred up to approve the truth of our Chriſtianity by the heavenlineſſe of our converſation, by living now where wee deſire to live for ever hereafter, by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving like <hi>Daniel,</hi> Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18. Like the <hi>Saints of the high ones,</hi> or <hi>high things,</hi> or <hi>places.</hi> What ſhould the Saints of <hi>high things</hi> doe, minding theſe <hi>low things</hi> here on earth? What ſhould the Saints of the <hi>high places</hi> doe converſing in theſe <hi>low</hi>

                     <hi>places</hi> on earth. Some <hi>low thoughts</hi> as of the earth, become not the Saints of the <hi>high places.</hi> Saints of the high places ſhould have their converſation in high places. There ſhould be a ſuiteableneſſe betweene mens conditions and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. If God have called them to the <hi>high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> If he have called them to be of the <hi>Saints of the high</hi>

It is the ſame word that is uſed in the verſe before this text, <hi>which minde earthly things.</hi> Though wee may not be <hi>Proudly high-minded,</hi> yet wee may and muſt be <hi>heavenly high-minded.</hi> Such an highmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe will prove us to be right bred Chriſtians indeed.

Hanna</hi> had vowed <hi>Samuel</hi> unto God, that he ſhould have his whole converſe in and about the Tabernacle in <hi>Shiloh.</hi> But yet ſhee brought him not preſently thither, but ſhe firſt weaned him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Hannah ſaid, I will not goe up untill the child</hi> bee weaned, <hi>and then I will bring him up that hee may appeare before the Lord, and there abide for ever.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>When ſhee had</hi> weaned him, <hi>ſhee tooke him up with her,</hi>

If a man ſometimes doe chance to make a ſteppe up to heaven, yet if hee be not weaned from the world, he will never long abide there, nor have his converſe there, his heart will bee hankering and lingering after the worlds breaſt, he will quickly come downe againe, that hee may be ſucking that Milke. The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the love, cares, and thoughts of the world to weights, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight.</hi> They are weights that hold, and keepe downe the heart from riſing up to heaven, or plucke downe the heart from heaven, if it be raiſed up towards heaven. A man that wil have his converſation in heaven muſt firſt have his heart lifted, and raiſed up into heaven, it muſt firſt <hi>be</hi> there before it can <hi>converſe</hi> there. Now how can the heart lift and raiſe up it ſelfe into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if it be clogged with a company of weights; if it could raiſe it ſelfe upwards, yet theſe waights would ſoone pull, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:233:176"/> weigh it downe againe. An Eagle <hi>flies towards heaven, Prov.</hi> 23. 5. But if an Eagle had waights faſtned to her legges, ſhee could not flie at all, much leſſe towards heaven. If therefore we would converſe in heaven, wee muſt firſt ſore up into heaven; and if wee would mount, and flie up into heaven, wee muſt firſt get looſe from theſe weights, get our hearts looſe and free from the love and cares of this world. Yea theſe are not onely weights, but they are as Bird-lime to thoſe wings upon which we ſhould mount up to heaven. Worldly things are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>No man that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth entangles himſelfe with the affaires of this life.</hi> A Bird that is entangled with a ſnare, that is entangled with lime-twigs cannot flie up aloft; and the love and cares of the world doe entangle the ſpirit of a man, ſo as he cannot raiſe it up into heaven. And he that cannot raiſe up his heart into heaven, cannot have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation there. Firſt, get we our hearts to bee eſtranged from the earth, and then wee ſhall the more willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in heaven. That man will hardly come to live in the countrey, to have his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:233:177"/> abode and converſation there, that hath not firſt weaned himſelfe from the City, ſo long as his minde is to the City hee will hardly like to leade a Countrey-life. When once <hi>David</hi> had got his heart off from the world, ſee how ſpiritually and heavenly minded he was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 19, 20. <hi>I am a ſtranger in the earth,</hi> hee had alienated his heart and eſtranged his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the world, and ſee what followes, <hi>Hide not thy Commandements from mee, my ſoule breakes for the longing that it hath unto thy judgements at all times.</hi> Wee ſee the Patriarches were heavenly minded perſons, had their converſation in heaven, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 16.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> yee muſt doe as our Saviour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> preſcribes, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Lay up treaſures in heaven.</hi> Make heavenly things your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, hoard up there and lay up there as much as may be, and then yee ſhall ſoone have your converſation there.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:233:177"/> Then the converſation is in heaven when the heart and affections are in heaven as wee ſaw before. The way to have the heart in heaven, is to have the treaſure there, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 20, 21. <hi>Lay up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven; for where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Get your treaſure into heaven, and you ſhall eaſily get your hearts into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for if the treaſure bee once in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the heart will ſoone bee in heaven too; for the heart and the treaſure will be undivided. What is the reaſon that many have their converſation on earth, but becauſe they lay up their treaſure on earth, and they make theſe earthly things their treaſures? So if treaſure were laid up in heaven, and heavenly things made our treaſure, our converſation would be in heaven, for the heart would follow and runne after the treaſure. Make Chriſt thy treaſure, make him the welbeloved of thy ſoule, make him the pearle of great price, prize him ſo as to count all earthly things as dung and droſſe to him, and Chriſt in heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made our treaſure will draw our hearts up into heaven. And when the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:233:178"/> heart is drawne up into heaven, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is there. Looke where the Loadſtone is, that way it draws the yron. If the Loadſtone bee beneath, it drawes the yron downeward; if it be above, it drawes the yron upwards. Pitch our Loadſtone in heaven, make Chriſt our Loadſtone, and then our hearts will up apace into heaven, as mens hearts goe ſo faſt downwards, becauſe their Loadſtone is in the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hee muſt get an intrinſecall principle of grace into his heart, that may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be continually lifting, heaving, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the heart upward, and heaven-ward. Heavy things they naturally affect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend and to goe downeward, becauſe they have an intrinſecall principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that inclines them to deſcend. And light things, they naturally affect to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and goe upwards, becauſe they have an intrinſecall principle that carries them that way. Now a man that would have his converſation in heaven ſhould get ſuch an inward principle of grace into his heart, that ſhould bee carrying the heart ſtill upward. A man muſt get a ſanctified frame of heart, that ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:233:178"/> bent of his ſpirit may be to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to be heaving and lifting upwards, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, doe I lift up my ſoule.</hi> By that phraſe is expreſſed the ſtrange deſires of a ſervant to his wages, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt give him his hire, for hee ſets his heart upon it,</hi> or hee <hi>lifts up his ſoule unto it.</hi> Looke now how a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants heart is lifted up to his hire, how he ſets his heart upon it, how his minde runs upon it, ſo ſuch a frame of Spirit ſhould a man get, that his heart ſhould be lifting up it ſelfe to God, and Chriſt, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that though a man may have ſome diverſions, and ſome occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that may put his heart off heaven for a time, yet thoſe diverſions no ſooner over but a mans heart ſhould bee upon heaven againe, and never well but when it is ſet that way. The needle of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe being once toucht with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, though by ſome violent ſhaking it may bee carried to this and to that point of the compaſſe, yet if once that violence ceaſe, it ceaſes not till it turne to the North-point, and reſt there. So if once a man had his heart toucht with Chriſt, though a man may have troubles, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:233:179"/> diſtractions by reaſon of ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet the heart would quickly bee upon heaven againe, and not be at reſt till it were pitcht that way againe. Get therefore a ſanctified frame of heart, and then thou wilt bee thinking of heaven, minding of heaven, talking of heaven, trading for heaven; yet that will make thee uſe thine earthly calling with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mind, that what ever thine imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be, yet thy minde ſhall be running on heaven, and ſo thy converſation ſhall be in heaven. There is a great deale of difference betweene heavenly thoughts that may bee caſt into a mans heart, and heavenly thoughts that breed in, riſe, and ſpring out of a mans heart. A man may have heavenly thoughts caſt in his heart, and yet not have his converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Many a worldly man may have thoughts and mindings of heaven, thrown or caſt into his heart, God may caſt ſuch thoughts ſometimes into his heart: and it may bee a good ſermon may ſo farre worke upon him as to put ſome thoughts of heaven into him, but all this while this is no converſation in heaven: theſe are but thoughts <hi>in their</hi> hearts, but not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:233:179"/> thoughts <hi>of their</hi> hearts. But now when ſuch thoughts are thoughts <hi>of the</hi> heart, they are bred in the heart, and the heart it ſelfe raiſes them and brings them forth, then in ſuch thoughts a man hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven. Now then onely doth the heart breed and raiſe ſuch thoughts of it ſelfe, when the frame of it is ſanctified, when there is a principle of grace in it. The fire that is come downe from heaven burning in it cauſes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts to aſcend like pillars of ſmoke. Fire doth not more naturally cauſe ſmoke to ariſe, and aſcend upwards towards heaven, then grace in a ſanctified heart cauſes the thoughts of it to make aſcenſions into heaven. When a man hath a ſanctified frame of heart, what ever hee is doing, what ever his employments, what ever his diſcourſes are, ſtill hee is minding heaven. That looke as it is with a man that hath a worldly frame of heart, ſo ſoone as he wakes in the morning, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently before his eyes be well open, he is thinking of the world; when hee eates and drinkes, ſtill the world is in his mind, when hee walkes, rides upon the way, ſtill his mind is upon his penny, upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:233:180"/> yea when hee ſleepes, hee dreames of the world, and of his gaine: let him bee at his prayers, yet in prayer his heart is upon his ſhop, his cuſtomers, his market, his barnes, and his ſackes; let him be at a ſermon, where hee ſeemes to ſit very attentively, and yet then his <hi>heart goes after covetouſneſſe, Eze.</hi> 33. 31. Let him come to the Lords Table, yet there the world, and his heart cannot ſunder. Now what is the reaſon that this man ſo truely hath his converſation in the world, hath his thoughts thus continually upon the world? Becauſe he hath a worldly frame of heart, and the frame of it being earthly theſe earthly vapours breed out of it, and it is reſtleſly raiſing theſe earthly muddy thoughts. So now in this caſe, if a man once have a ſanctified frame of heart that would thus breed heavenly thoughts, that what ever he were about, yet his thoughts would be upon and in heaven. When he awakes in the morning, he would awake as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 18. <hi>When I awake I am ſtill with thee:</hi> ſo ſoone as mine eyes are open, mine heart is in heaven with thee; God and heaven are firſt in my thoughts ſo ſoone as I awake. <hi>Davids</hi> thoughts
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:233:180"/> lookt up to heaven and to God next his heart. When he ſits at table to eate and drinke, he hath ſome ſuch thought as that <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 15. <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eate bread in the Kingdome of God.</hi> When he lies in his bed, and it were time he were at his reſt, He prayes in his bed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 6. He me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates of heaven in his bed, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 16. 7. he conferres in his bed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. he ſings in his bed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149, 5. When hee is in the workes of his calling, in the employments of the world, even when at the hotteſt, yet his heart hath its lookes to heaven, he hath an eye ſtill to heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. 1, 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee I lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwelleſt in the heavens, behold as the eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their maſters, and as the eyes of a mayden unto the hands of her miſtreſſe, &amp;c.</hi> I know the text hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence, I do onely allude to it. Ye ſhall ſee Ladies Wayting-gentlewomen, and mayds, they waite on their Ladies with their worke in their hands, they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their worke, but yet ever and anon they are caſting their eyes to their Ladies, and ſtill as they are working, have an eye to them: ſo it is with a man that hath a ſanctified gracious frame of heart, hee is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:233:181"/> following his earthly and worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but yet ever and anon hee is lifting up his eyes, and his heart to God in the heavens, ſtill his heart is looking that way, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> opened his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and looked towards <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And as an earthly man in an heavenly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of prayer, hearing, and receiving the Sacrament will have an earthly, ſo he in an earthly buſineſſe, in his ſhop, in his field, at his plow, will have an heavenly heart, and ſo converſes in heaven in the very heat and middeſt of ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Such a man as he rides by the way, as hee walkes with company will have conference, and diſcourſe that ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence an heart in heaven. Yea an heart ſanctified hath ſuch a bent towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that his heart is in heaven, in his very ſleepe that hee often hath ſweet dreames of heaven, and things belonging to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus if a man get once ſuch a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified frame of heart, he ſhall be ſure to have his converſation in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſerves to condemne two ſorts of perſons, and convinces them to be <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> no true Chriſtians indeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſhoales out all prophane, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unholy perſons from being true
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:233:181"/> Chriſtians. We have a great many that live like heathens, prophane ſwearers, neglecters and contemners of holineſſe, and all holy duties of obedience, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, uncleane perſons, and the like; and yet theſe would thinke themſelves much wronged if a man ſhould call the truth of their Chriſtianity in queſtion Well then, put it upon this tryall, try them by a Chriſtians converſation. Hee that is a Chriſtian is of a Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. He that is of a Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, hath his converſation in heaven. Now I appeale to ſuch mens conſciences whether their converſation be in heaven or not, whether they live with ſuch holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; obedience for the kind of it, as the Saints in heaven do. Thou haſt a ſwearing, an uncleane, an adulterous converſation, a drunken converſation, thou haſt thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation amongſt Godleſſe prophane perſons, thy converſation in Ale-houſes, Whore-houſes, and ſuch like. Now I ſay, let ſuch mens owne conſciences judge whether ſuch a converſation be a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven. Surely ſuch a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather a converſation in hell. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and blaſpheming is the courſe of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:233:182"/> damned in hell. Thy converſation is as farre from being in heaven, as hell it ſelfe is from heaven. A Chriſtians converſation is in heaven, therefore they are no true Chriſtians that have their converſation in hell. What is living unholily, uncleanely, drunkenly, vitiouſly but living helliſhly? Therefore ſuch mens owne hearts muſt needs tell them that they are as farre from being true Chriſtians, as they are from having a Chriſtians converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſhoales out all earthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worldly hearted perſons, ſuch as minde earthly things from the number of true Chriſtians. There are a number of errant earth-wormes, muddy dirty worldlings, who minde nothing but earthly things, and becauſe they are not ſo prophane, and vitious perſons as the former, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may bee they frequent publique duties of worſhip, and performe ſome in private too, and have a forme of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, therefore they all to be-Saint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make no queſtion but they are excellent good Chriſtians. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the former verſe ſpeakes not onely of voluptuous belly-gods, but of ſuch as <hi>mind earthly things,</hi> and hee oppoſes a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:233:182"/> converſation in heaven not onely to a voluptuous converſation, but to the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of earthly things. So that a minder of earthly things is as farre from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven, as he that is a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous belly-god. And marke that he ſaies of them both that their end is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not onely whoring, drunkenneſſe, and gluttony, but minding of earthly things will alſo damne a mans ſoule, and bring him to hell too, as well as they. So that minders of earthly things are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians then they. Outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of religion may ſtand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with earthly-mindedneſſe, and men may goe to hell with both. Well, but yet theſe will needs bee true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there is no remedy; let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be put to the tryall. A true Chriſtians converſation is in heaven, if then they be true Chriſtians, then is their converſation there alſo. But where is their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are not their mindes, affections, and converſation wholly on the earth? What is it they minde? earthly things. What is it their hearts are habitually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up withall? earthly things. What is it they continually ſpeake and diſcourſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:233:183"/> of? earthly things. Come into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and put the queſtion to them that our Saviour put to the two diſciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Emmaus, Luke</hi> 24. 17. <hi>What manner of communications are theſe that ye have one with another as ye walke.</hi> Can they anſwere as they did, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Concerning Ieſus of Nazareth.</hi> No, but concerning Sheepe, and Oxen, bargaines, farmes, prizes, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, &amp;c. Their breath like the breath of a dying man ſmells earthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Hee that is of the earth, is of the earth, and ſpeakes of the earth.</hi> And he that ſpeakes of the earth, and minds the earth, hee is of the earth, and hee is in the earth, up to the hard eares in the earth, and hath his converſation altogether on the earth. That looke as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe falſe teachers, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 5. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeake they of the world.</hi> So of theſe on the contrary. They ſpeake altogether of the world, they thinke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of the world, they altogether mind the world, and therefore they are of the world, and they dwell on earth. They are like moles alwaies working in the earth, and under-ground. How are theſe true Chriſtians that are enemies to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:233:183"/> Chriſts croſſe? There be many ſaies the Apoſtle in the 18 verſe of this chapter, <hi>that are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> Certainely ſuch are no true Chriſtians. But who bee they that bee ſuch? <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>who mind earthly things.</hi> Theſe men <hi>licke the duſt,</hi> and therefore as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants upon that text, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 9. They are amongſt the enemies of Chriſt.

Is this to have ones converſation in heaven? Hee that hath his converſation on earth, hath not his converſation in heaven; and he that hath not his converſation in heaven is no true Chriſtian. This is one ſure evidence of a man that hath his converſation on earth, that if he might be at his choice he would be content to have his abode and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth forever; yea and would give God a diſcharge forever, for laying any clayme to heaven, ſo God would but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:233:184"/> aſſure him of a perpetuity here. Too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be of the prophane Cardinall of <hi>Burbons</hi> minde, who would not give his part in <hi>Paris</hi> for his part in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> It is with too many in this caſe, as it was with thoſe, 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 4 23. <hi>Theſe were potters, and thoſe that dwelt amongſt plants, and hedges. There they dwelt with the King for his worke.</hi> The meaning of that place is to ſhew the baſeneſſe of ſome of the Jewes that when liberty was proclaimed for their returne to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> where they might have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the freedome of their owne Countrey, and religion, yet becauſe they got their living with making pots for the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they thought themſelves well as they were, and they rather choſe to ſtay under the hedges of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to live hedge-roagues there, then to goe to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> where they might have lived free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and have enjoyed the ordinances of Gods worſhip. The holy Ghoſt brands them for baſe perſons. And ſo it is with many, might they but abide here for ever, with what they have, they had rather live here under the hedges of the <hi>Babylon</hi> of this world, then be at the paines to goe to the heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> A ſure ſigne
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:233:184"/> where their converſation is, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation proclaimes what kind of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians they be. Earthly minded Chriſtians then, are no true Chriſtians, they have not their converſations in heaven.</p>
                  <p>But wee have many good thoughts of <label type="milestone">

                  <p>It is not to be denyed but that worldly <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> men may have ſome thoughts of heaven, and about heaven; but yet for all that their converſation is not in heaven. That will appeare if their thoughts be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what kinde of thoughts they be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> their thoughts of heaven are but <hi>flitting thoughts,</hi> they come and goe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> tarry not, abide not in the heart, they come and goe like flaſhes of lightning, they take up their lodging in the heart. The man that hath his converſation in heaven, his thoughts of heaven are not flaſhes and glances, but ſetled habituall permanent thoughts.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:233:185"/> onely a bed for a night, but they can ſtay ſeaven yeeres together with thee, &amp; thou never thinkſt their company troubleſom. But when thoughts of heaven come into thine heart, there is hardly a bed, or a nights lodging to be had for them, that is too too long, but it may be thou ſaluteſt them, &amp; then giveſt them their paſſe, and ſo fare them well. Such thoughts are no arguments of a converſation in heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be theſe thoughts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heaven are but <hi>accidentall,</hi> they come by chance, not ſtudied, purpoſed thoughts, but onely ſuch as chop in by the by. The thoughts of heaven that a man hath that hath his converſation in heaven, are intended thoughts, purpoſed and ſtudied thoughts, hee ſets himſelfe to thinke of heaven, and the things of heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may bee theſe bee <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>thoughts</hi> that leave no manner of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the heart. It may bee thou haſt ſome thoughts of heaven but the way of theſe thoughts in thine heart are as <hi>the way of an eagle in the ayre, as the way of a ſerpent upon a rocke, as the way of a ſhip in the heart of the Sea, Prov.</hi> 30. 18. What impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion leaves an Eagle in the ayre? what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:233:185"/> doth a ſerpent leave upon an hard rocke, or what impreſſion doth a ſhip leave in the heart of the ſea? Iuſt ſuch an impreſſion as thoughts of heaven leave in thine heart, that is juſt none at all. They leave not ſuch a worke behind them as to make thee looke ere the more after heaven, they leave no ſuch worke as to make thee ere the leſſe earthly, thou art as earthly and eager after the love of the world, after theſe thoughts as ever thou waſt before. It is not ſo with ſuch as have their converſation in heaven. Their thoughts and mindings of heaven are ſuch as leave ſtrong impreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, ſuch as make them take more paines for grace, for Chriſt then before. Therefore ſee how the Apoſtle joynes theſe two together <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. The ſetting of the affections upon things above, or the <hi>minding of things above,</hi> and the <hi>ſeeking of things above.</hi> They then that <hi>mind</hi> things above, &amp; have their thoughts upon things above as they ſhould have, they <hi>ſeeke</hi> things that are above. Their mindings and thinkings of heaven are ſuch as worke ſtrong Impreſſions in them, as make them induſtrious, laborious in the

A thought of heaven that makes a man <hi>wiſh</hi> for heaven is a fruitleſſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing thought, but a thought of heaven that will make a man <hi>worke</hi> for heaven is the thought of the man that hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven.
